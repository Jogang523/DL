Through here.\\n Tess: Joel, over here.\\n Tess: Look at his sleeve. Firefly.\\n Joel: These guys aren\\'t doin\\' too well in or out of the city. Let\\'s hope\\n Joel: They\\'re from the quarantine zone.\\n Tess: See...they\\'re not our guys.\\n Joel: Over there, see it?\\n Tess: Shit. God, we\\'re almost out. Okay, Joel, you take point. I\\'ll watch the\\n Ellie: Sure.\\n Joel: This way. We\\'re almost out. C\\'mon.\\n Tess: Yeah, go over there. Quick, before it comes back.\\n Joel: Alright.

Let\\'s move.\\n Ellie: You guys are pretty good at this stuff.\\n Joel: It\\'s called luck, and it is gonna run out. Which way we goin\\', Tess?\\n Tess: Uh...capitol building\\'s in this direction. How do we get up over this\\n Joel: Climb on up. Maybe we can cut through here.\\n Ellie: Yeah, that worked out great last time. Sorry -- I\\'m just sayin\\'.\\n Tess: Shhh-shh.\\n Joel: What? I don\\'t hear anything.\\n Tess: Okay, double time.\\n Joel: Oh, shit....\\n Ellie: Oh -- they\\'re coming.\\n Joel: I know.\\n Tess: Okay, that\\'s good, that\\'s good. Go.\\n Ellie: Okay, Joel.\\n Joel: Drop it!\\n Ellie: Oh...you got something on your shoe.\\n Ellie: Gross.\\n Joel: Okay. How do we get out of this place?\\n Tess: Let\\'s find out. So Marlene thinks your immune?\\n Ellie: Well, that\\'s what she believes.\\n Tess: Well, how were you bitten? I mean you must\\'ve been somewhere you\\n Ellie: Yeah, I\\'d sneak out. I was in this military boarding school.\\n Tess: You\\'d sneak out?\\n Ellie: You know, explore the city. I was in the mall when I ran into infected.\\n Tess: That place is completely off-limits. How the hell did you get in there?\\n Ellie: I...had my ways. Anyways, one of those -- what you guys call runners\\n Tess: I see. Were you with Marlene when you were bitten?\\n Ellie: No. I went to her for help afterwards.\\n Tess: Knowing her, I\\'m surprised she didn\\'t shoot you.\\n Ellie: She almost did. Hope she\\'s alright.\\n Tess: I told you. She\\'s gonna be fine.\\n Ellie: Ow. Shit. Sorry, sorry. That was me.\\n Joel: Tess.\\n Ellie: Sorry!\\n Tess: C\\'mon. Stay close to me.\\n Ellie: What is this place?\\n Tess: It\\'s an old museum. Some of these things are hundreds of years old.\\n Ellie: Really? Wow.\\n Joel: Alright, watch your head. Hurry. Go, go, go. Shit...sonofa...\\n Tess: Joel. Joel!\\n Joel: I\\'m alive. I\\'ll make my way around to you.\\n Ellie: Oh... Look they\\'re here!\\n Joel: Tess?\\n Tess: Run.

This way. This\\'ll get us to the roof.\\n Joel: How \\'bout you, kid? You okay?\\n Ellie: Define okay.\\n Joel: Are you still breathing?\\n Ellie: Do small, panicked breaths count?\\n Joel: Yeah, they count.\\n Ellie: Alright. Then I\\'m okay.\\n Tess: We gotta find a way across. There she is. That\\'s our building.\\n Joel: Alright. Now watch your step as you goin\\' up \\'cause it\\'s gonna be a\\n Ellie: Pssh.\\n Joel: Well, is that everything you hoped for?\\n Ellie: Jury\\'s still out. But, man...you can\\'t deny that view.\\n Tess: C\\'mon. This way. Hey! Pick it up. Look, we\\'re almost done. Stay focused.\\n Joel: Yes, ma\\'am.\\n Tess: It\\'s right around this corner. C\\'mon.\\n Joel: Let\\'s keep moving, kid.\\n Joel: There we go. Home stretch, Tess.\\n Ellie: Um...just so it\\'s out there. I can\\'t swim.\\n Tess: Look, it looks like it\\'s shallow on the right side. Follow me.\\n Ellie: I\\'m glad Marlene hired you guys.\\n Tess: What do you mean?\\n Ellie: I know you guys are getting paid for this -- but I\\'m trying to say\\n Tess: Yeah, sure thing.\\n Tess: No. No, no.\\n Ellie: What happens now?\\n Joel: What are you doing, Tess?\\n Tess: Oh, god. Maybe they, ah, maybe they had a map or something to tell us\\n Joel: How far are we gonna take this?\\n Tess: As far as it needs to go. Where was this lab of theirs?\\n Ellie: She never said. She only mentioned it was someplace out west.\\n Joel: What are we doing here? This is not us.\\n Tess: What do you know about us? About me?\\n Joel: I know that you are smarter than this.\\n Tess: Really? Guess what, we\\'re shitty people, Joel. It\\'s been that way for a\\n Joel: No, we are survivors!\\n Tess: This is our chance--\\n Joel: It is over, Tess! Now we tried. Let\\'s just go home.\\n Tess: I\\'m not...I\\'m not going anywhere. This is my last stop.\\n Joel: What?\\n Tess: Our luck had to run out sooner or later.\\n Joel: What are you going on about--\\n Tess: No don\\'t-- Don\\'t touch me.\\n Ellie: Holy shit. She\\'s infected.\\n Tess: Joel...\\n Joel: Let me see it.\\n Tess: I didn\\'t mean for this--\\n Joel: Show it to me.\\n Joel: Oh, Christ.\\n Tess: Oops, right? Give me your arm.\\n Tess: This was three weeks. I was bitten an hour ago and it\\'s already worse.\\n Joel: No, no, no, that was your crusade. I am not doin\\' that.\\n Tess: Yes you are. Look, there\\'s enough here that you have to feel some sort\\n Ellie: Shit.\\n Tess: Oh...\\n Guard: Watch the exit!\\n Tess: They\\'re here.\\n Joel: Dammit.\\n Tess: I can buy you some time, but you have to run.\\n Ellie: What? You want us to just leave you here?\\n Tess: Yes.\\n Joel: There is no way that--\\n Tess: I will not turn into one of those things. Come on. Make this easy for me.\\n Joel: I can fight--\\n Tess: No, just go! Just fucking go.\\n Joel: Ellie.\\n Ellie: I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t -- I didn\\'t mean for this.\\n Joel: Get a move on.\\n Guard: We know you\\'re in there! Drop your weapons and come out with your hands\\n Ellie: What the fuck! I can\\'t believe we did that.\\n Joel: Stop.\\n Ellie: We just left her to die.\\n Joel: Stop. You stay close to me. We need to move.\\n Ellie: Oh man...\\n Joel: Just keep pushing forward.\\n Ellie: Oh my god. Tess...\\n Guard: Target neutralized. She took out two of my men. Copy that. You, take\\n Guard 2: Yes, sir.\\n Ellie: They\\'re gonna be here soon.\\n Joel: We\\'re through.\\n Ellie: What do we do? Joel?\\n Joel: I got this.\\n Ellie: What\\'re we doing? Joel, how\\'re we gonna get outta here?\\n Joel: Alright. We\\'re gonna have to go through that hall.\\n Guard: They had to come through here. Comb the area.\\n Joel: Stay down. I don\\'t know how many more there are.\\n Guard: They still haven\\'t found the last two.\\n Guard 2: I heard one of \\'em was a kid.\\n Guard: Does it matter? They took out a bunch of our guys.\\n Guard 2: Jesus. Well hey, after today this whole Firefly bullshit will be\\n Ellie: Joel, there\\'s the exit.\\n Joel: I see it.\\n Ellie: There\\'s stairs over there.\\n Joel: Stay low.\\n Guard: They\\'re going into the subway! Stop \\'em!\\n Joel: Shit.\\n Ellie: They\\'re following us!\\n Joel: Goddammit.\\n Ellie: Get down.\\n Guard: No target. I repeat, no target.\\n Ellie: There\\'s a soldier over there.\\n Radio: Understood. Hold your position and wait for reinforcements.\\n Guard: Copy that. Holding position.\\n Joel: How the hell are you breathin\\' in this stuff?\\n Ellie: I wasn\\'t lying to you.\\n Guard 2: Did you spot \\'em?\\n Guard: No, place is empty.\\n Guard 2: Let\\'s find them and get the hell out of here before clickers show up.\\n Ellie: Hey, uh, I can\\'t swim.\\n Joel: We\\'ll figure something out.\\n Ellie: Hey look, it still works.\\n Joel: There\\'s a ladder. Maybe we can use that.\\n Joel: Get on.\\n Ellie: Really?\\n Joel: Ellie.\\n Ellie: Okay, okay. Ah, be careful.\\n Joel: I gotcha.\\n Joel: I got it. Alright, let\\'s get outta here.\\n Ellie: Hey, look, um...about Tess... I don\\'t even know what to--\\n Joel: Here\\'s how this thing\\'s gonna play out. You don\\'t bring up Tess -- ever.\\n Ellie: Sure.\\n Joel: Repeat it.\\n Ellie: What you say, goes.\\n Joel: Good. Now, there\\'s a town a few miles north of here. There\\'s a fella\\n Ellie: Okay.\\n Joel: Let\\'s get a move on.\\n Joel: Now there we go... Yeah, it\\'ll be faster to go through here.\\n Ellie: Man...\\n Joel: What?\\n Ellie: Nothing. It\\'s just...I\\'ve never seen anything like this, that\\'s all.\\n Joel: You mean the woods?\\n Ellie: Yeah. Never walked through the woods. It\\'s kinda cool.\\n Ellie: Why don\\'t you just take me back to Marlene?\\n Joel: If she was up to the task, why\\'d she drop you off on us?\\n Ellie: Well, maybe she\\'s better now.\\n Joel: Kid, I don\\'t mean to upset you, but your friend\\'s chances of survival\\n Ellie: She\\'s a lot tougher than you think.\\n Joel: It don\\'t matter. \\'Cause I doubt I could get either one of us back into\\n Ellie: Whoa. Hey, buddy.\\n Joel: Well, shit.\\n Ellie: Should we climb it?\\n Joel: No, wire on top of it. We gotta find a way to go around.\\n Ellie: Whoa, look. Fireflies. I mean, real fireflies.\\n Joel: Yeah, I see that.\\n Ellie: Sorry, I...I lost myself for a sec.\\n Joel: Here we go.\\n Joel: That you, Bill?\\n Ellie: Where do you usually meet him?\\n Joel: Huh? Different places.\\n Ellie: You\\'ve never been here, have you?\\n Joel: I know this is where he lives, but...no, I ain\\'t never been here\\n Ellie: And that smoke, you think that\\'s him?\\n Joel: Sure as hell better be.\\n Ellie: Well, let\\'s go check it out then.\\n Joel: Alright, come on. Down here. Watch your step; it\\'s a good drop.\\n Joel: Are you alright?\\n Ellie: I\\'m trying to learn how to whistle.\\n Joel: You don\\'t know how to whistle?\\n Ellie: Well does it sound like I know how to whistle?\\n Joel: Oh, shit. It\\'s jammed from the other side.\\n Ellie: Here, boost me up.\\n Joel: No, that\\'s not such a good idea.\\n Ellie: Well, I can\\'t boost you up. How else are we gonna open it?\\n Joel: Alright. Gimme your foot. Now just open it. Nothing else.\\n Ellie: Sure thing.\\n Joel: Careful.\\n Ellie: Okay. Ah, let\\'s see. Okay. Ta-da.\\n Joel: Good job.\\n Ellie: Thank you. So, let\\'s say we get a car from this buddy of yours. Then\\n Joel: Well, then we go find Tommy.\\n Ellie: Marlene said he\\'s your brother.\\n Joel: And more importantly he was a Firefly. He\\'d know where to take you.\\n Ellie: Oh, okay.\\n Joel: He lives far from here which is why we need the car.\\n Ellie: Hey, look. Gnomes.\\n Joel: Yeah. Those are gnomes.\\n Ellie: Man, I had an art book filled with these. I always thought they were\\n Joel: Alright, then.\\n Ellie: Oh...look at that.\\n Joel: What, you play this before?\\n Ellie: Nah. But I had a friend that knew everything about this game.\\n Joel: Well, I was never a big fan of these things.\\n Ellie: I wish I could play it.\\n Ellie: \"Mandatory evacuation.\" Evacuate to where?\\n Joel: Where you think? Quarantine zone. See, some places got a head\\'s up\\n Ellie: Man, must be hard. Just...leaving all your stuff behind like that.\\n Joel: That ain\\'t the hard part.\\n Joel: Hmm. Yeah, that\\'s Bill\\'s handiwork.\\n Ellie: Anybody else live in this town?\\n Joel: Far as I know, it\\'s just him.\\n Ellie: Fireflies were everywhere, huh?\\n Joel: Yeah, they were. Hoping to restore the country to what it was.\\n Ellie: Well...with a vaccine, maybe they will.\\n Joel: Maybe.\\n Joel: Jesus!\\n Ellie: Whoa, Nelly. Wha--? What the hell was that?\\n Joel: That...would be one of Bill\\'s traps.\\n Ellie: Your friend a bit paranoid, maybe?\\n Joel: Now that\\'s putting it lightly.\\n Ellie: What\\'s the deal with this guy?\\n Joel: Well, he helped us smuggle stuff into the city. He\\'s... He knows how to\\n Ellie: Well let\\'s hope we don\\'t blow up trying to find him.\\n Joel: Just watch your step. You\\'ll be fine.\\n Ellie: Geez. Bill good with a bow?\\n Joel: I reckon he is.\\n Joel: Hey... Look at that.\\n Ellie: Let me use that. I\\'m a pretty good shot with that thing.\\n Joel: How \\'bout we just leave this kind of stuff to me.\\n Ellie: Well, we could both be armed. Cover each other.\\n Joel: I don\\'t think so.\\n Joel: Here, we can actually use this. It\\'s all clear, come on up.\\n Ellie: Alright.\\n Joel: Let\\'s give this baby a whirl.\\n Ellie: Oh fuck.\\n Joel: Now, listen. Bill ain\\'t exactly the most stable of individuals. So when\\n Ellie: I understand.\\n Joel: We gotta be clear on this. He... He don\\'t take too kindly to strangers.\\n Ellie: Alright.\\n Joel: Bill\\'s a good guy, he just definitely needs some time warming up to you,\\n Joel: See that wire? Stay underneath it okay? Just keep your head low and\\n Ellie: Alright.\\n Ellie: You hear that?\\n Joel: Yeah.\\n Ellie: Oh, shit, you\\'re gonna go in there?\\n Joel: I wanna see what we can find.\\n Ellie: You\\'re gonna find my body when I die from a heart attack.\\n Joel: Don\\'t worry. I got this.\\n Ellie: Geez. That thing scared the shit outta me.\\n Joel: Well, while we\\'re here, let\\'s search the place.\\n Joel: C\\'mon, let\\'s get the hell outta here.\\n Ellie: Okay.\\n Joel: Shit. Look at this. Alright, stand back.\\n Ellie: Alright.\\n Joel: That\\'s one way to do it.\\n Ellie: Oh, shit. Those things are kinda awesome.\\n Joel: Yeah, see that? Get back.\\n Joel: Come on. Just stay close. Ellie, come on, just...\\n Joel: Oh, shit!\\n Ellie: Joel!\\n Joel: God...\\n Ellie: Here...I got you.\\n Joel: Goddammit, Bill...\\n Ellie: What just happened?\\n Joel: It\\'s another one of Bill\\'s stupid traps! There, that fridge. It looks\\n Ellie: Okay.\\n Joel: Cut that rope and it\\'ll bring me down!\\n Ellie: On it!\\n Ellie: Joel?\\n Joel: Shit, here they come!\\n Ellie: Joel!\\n Joel: Just tend to the rope!

Oh, goddamn.\\n Ellie: I\\'m going.\\n Bill: Where\\'s that goddamn key?\\n Ellie: Guys -- behind us!\\n Joel: Bill, come on!\\n Bill: Don\\'t slow down. This place ain\\'t secure.\\n Bill: Alright, come on -- we\\'re almost there. Follow me.\\n Joel: Oh, shit.\\n Bill: Goddammit! They\\'re coming from all over! C\\'mon! They\\'re gettin\\' through.\\n Joel: Move, Ellie, move!\\n Ellie: I\\'m going, I\\'m going!\\n Bill: It\\'s open, c\\'mon!\\n Ellie: Man...that was close. Uh...thanks for the heroics and all.\\n Ellie: Uh, Ellie.\\n Ellie: Hey, what are you-- Joel?\\n Joel: Bill.\\n Ellie: What are you doing?\\n Joel: Bill!\\n Ellie: Let me go!\\n Bill: Turn around and get on your knees.\\n Joel: Just calm down a second.\\n Bill: Turn around and get on your knees!\\n Joel: Alright!\\n Bill: Don\\'t test me!\\n Joel: Just...ah, take it easy.\\n Bill: You got any bites?\\n Joel: No.\\n Bill: Anything sprouting?\\n Joel: No, goddammit, I\\'m clean!\\n Bill: Well, I see so much as a twitch--\\n Bill: Ow!\\n Joel: Stop!\\n Bill: Son of a bitch!\\n Joel: You done?\\n Bill: Am I done...? You come into my house, you set off all my traps, you damn\\n Ellie: I am none of your goddamn business, and we\\'re here because you owe Joel\\n Bill: I owe Joel some favors, is this some kind of joke?\\n Joel: I\\'ll cut to the chase. I need a car.\\n Bill: Well, it is a joke. Joel needs a car. Well, if I had one that works,\\n Joel: By the looks of it, you could stand to lose some of that food.\\n Bill: You listen to me, you little shit--\\n Ellie: No, fuck you! You handcuffed me--\\n Joel: I need you to shut up. Alright?\\n Bill: Whatever favors you think I owe ya, it ain\\'t worth that much.\\n Joel: Actually, Bill, they are.\\n Bill: Well, it don\\'t matter \\'cause I don\\'t have a car that works.\\n Joel: But there is one in this town.\\n Bill: Parts. There are parts in this town.\\n Joel: Meaning that you could fix one up.\\n Bill: Alright. If I\\'m gonna do this, there\\'s some gear I\\'m gonna need.\\n Joel: Alright.\\n Bill: It\\'s on the other side of town. Now you help me go gather it, and maybe,\\n Joel: That\\'s fine.\\n Joel: Couple days from now, we\\'ll probably be dead anyway.\\n Bill: Good. Follow me. Whole goddamn town\\'s booby-trapped, best stay right on\\n Ellie: Can\\'t miss it.\\n Joel: Knock it off.\\n Bill: Alright. Whatever supplies you may want or need, I suggest you grab them.\\n Joel: Alright, thank you. Ellie, take a look around and see if there\\'s\\n Ellie: Alrighty.\\n Ellie: Man, he\\'s got a fuckin\\' stick up his ass.\\n Joel: Just...stay out of his way.\\n Ellie: Hey, you know how to play this?\\n Joel: Yeah. Pretty badly, yeah.\\n Ellie: I always wanted to learn.\\n Bill: Hey, Bobby Fischer -- don\\'t touch anything on that board!\\n Ellie: Bobby what?\\n Joel: Just let it go.\\n Bill: Found everything you need?\\n Joel: We\\'re good. Alright, Ellie. Come on.\\n Bill: Don\\'t leave the door open.\\n Joel: I got it.\\n Bill: We have to cross to the other building. Up the stairs. Let\\'s move it.\\n Ellie: Psh.\\n Joel: Just stay with me.\\n Bill: Can\\'t believe you agreed to this bullshit, Bill. What you shoulda done\\n Ellie: You weren\\'t kidding about him.\\n Joel: Yeah, he\\'s one of a kind. I\\'m gonna take a look around up here.\\n Bill: Nothin\\' in there that I need. Go ahead, take whatever you want.\\n Joel: Thanks.\\n Bill: So what kind of trouble are you in? Where the hell\\'s Tess?\\n Joel: It\\'s a job. A simple drop-off.\\n Bill: What are you delivering? That little brat?\\n Ellie: Haha. Fuck you, too.\\n Bill: Y\\'know, I hope you know what you\\'re doin\\'.\\n Ellie: Are you kidding me with this guy?\\n Joel: So, where we goin\\', Bill?\\n Bill: My other safehouse. It\\'s more of an armory.\\n Ellie: Wait, I thought we were gonna fix up a car?\\n Bill: We? You know how to fix a--\\n Joel: Bill, just...\\n Bill: It\\'s like I said, what I need is on the other side of town. Now, that\\n Joel: Shhh. There\\'s one inside\\n Bill: Oh...I\\'ve been meaning to take care of that. Relax, it\\'s nothin\\'. So\\n Tess: She\\'s busy.\\n Bill: Yeah, sure...busy.

I mean the whole time, why on earth hadn\\'t I\\n Ellie: Okay...don\\'t be a dick.\\n Bill: Their tires are rotted and their batteries are dead.\\n Ellie: Are you done?\\n Bill: Can\\'t even begin to think what the inside of the engine blocks look like.\\n Joel: Goddammit.\\n Ellie: Infected!\\n Bill: Alright... You gotta check the barricades again. You neglect the simple\\n Ellie: Okay, well now he\\'s talking to himself.\\n Joel: Yeah...Bill?\\n Bill: Joel? This way.\\n Bill: And up we go.\\n Joel: You picked a hell of a place to hole up, didn\\'t ya?\\n Bill: You know, as bad as those things are, at least they\\'re predictable. It\\'s\\n Ellie: What does that mean?\\n Joel: Nothin\\'. You sure that gate\\'s gonna hold \\'em?\\n Bill: Well, I locked it. They don\\'t have a key.\\n Joel: So, which way?\\n Bill: We\\'re here.

I\\'ll just wait around for you two to get me killed.\\n Bill: This goes on record as the worst fucking job you\\'ve ever taken.\\n Joel: It\\'s up there.\\n Bill: How in the hell is Tess okay with this suicide mission?\\n Joel: It\\'s actually her idea.\\n Bill: Really? Well, the broad\\'s not as smart as I thought she was. But...fuck\\n Joel: Bill, I can\\'t just take her back.\\n Bill: Then send her packing, let her find her own way. Let me tell you a story.\\n Joel: Bill, it...it ain\\'t like that. It\\'s--\\n Bill: Bullshit. It is just like that.\\n Bill: Hey! What did I say to you when we walked down the steps? What did I say?\\n Ellie: I\\'m just fixing your stupid pile.\\n Bill: Don\\'t touch!\\n Bill: Goddamnit. You keep babysitting long enough and eventually it\\'s gonna\\n Joel: Bill. Can we please just get on with it?\\n Bill: Here. Let\\'s get on with it. Alright, before we go any further, I got\\n Joel: Whatcha got?\\n Bill: New toy from the toy box. This...is a nail bomb. You gotta be really\\n Joel: Yeah, I\\'ve seen your handiwork.\\n Bill: Pretty good, huh?\\n Joel: So we got shotguns and bombs.

I wanted to get it, but it seemed to dangerous with all the\\n Joel: What if it\\'s damaged?\\n Bill: Nah. Those trucks are like tanks. It\\'s just sittin\\' there.\\n Joel: Actually might work.\\n Bill: Kid, I swear to god...if you took anything--\\n Ellie: Hey, man. I don\\'t need any of your shit. Trust me.\\n Bill: Joel, you are keeping an eye on her, right?\\n Joel: Like a hawk.\\n Ellie: Wow.\\n Joel: Nice place you got here.\\n Bill: Well, if you got anything to confess, this\\'d be the place to do it.\\n Bill: That\\'s not the confessional booth, that\\'s my room.\\n Joel: Alright, I\\'m not touchin\\' anything.

That was plan A, B,\\n Joel: Don\\'t you bring Tess into this!\\n Bill: --she can shove it right up--\\n Joel: She\\'s got nothin\\' to do with--!\\n Joel: Jesus. What? Do you know this guy or something?\\n Bill: Frank.\\n Joel: Who the hell\\'s Frank?\\n Bill: He was my partner. He\\'s the only idiot that would wear a shirt like that.\\n Joel: I reckon he didn\\'t want to turn so he...\\n Bill: Yeah. I guess not. Well fuck him.\\n Ellie: Look what I found. It\\'s got some juice in it.\\n Bill: That\\'s my battery. That fuckin\\' asshole. Get out. Get out.\\n Ellie: Okay, geez.\\n Bill: Battery\\'s drained but the cells are alive.\\n Joel: Meaning?\\n Bill: Meaning we push it, get it started and the alternator will recharge the\\n Joel: Is that your guess?\\n Bill: Look, you wanted a \"plan B.\" This is as good as it gets.\\n Ellie: What\\'re you thinking?\\n Joel: Thinkin\\' you drive and we push.\\n Bill: Jesus...that\\'s more of my stuff. You just...just gonna steal my stuff\\n Joel: That\\'s a good idea.\\n Bill: Let me know when you\\'re ready to finish this thing!\\n Joel: I\\'ll give you a holler.\\n Joel: You gonna be okay with this?\\n Ellie: Yeah, not a problem.\\n Joel: You\\'re doin\\' a good job. I figure you should know that.\\n Ellie: I won\\'t let you down with this.\\n Joel: Alright...\\n Bill: Ready?\\n Joel: Bill, I uh...I found this in there and I...I figured you should have it.\\n Bill: That\\'s how you feel. Well, fuck you too, Frank. Fuckin\\' idiot. You ready\\n Joel: Alright, Bill, let\\'s do it.\\n Bill: Alright, put \\'er in first.\\n Ellie: Already did it.\\n Bill: Just keep your foot on the clutch and when we get to roll...\\n Ellie: I know how to pop a clutch.\\n Bill: How the hell do--? Y\\'know what, I don\\'t care. Just don\\'t fuck it up!\\n Joel: Alright, Ellie, get ready... Now! Now, hit it. Hit it!\\n Bill: Perfect. Hey -- good job, kid.\\n Joel: Bill, not helpin\\'.

Back to the truck.\\n Ellie: We gotta go faster!\\n Bill: Look, if we just make it to the hill. We just get it over the edge...\\n Bill: C\\'mon, back to the truck. We don\\'t have much time. You have really\\n Joel: Alright, Ellie, get ready... Alright, Ellie, start it up!\\n Joel: You hear that sound, Bill?\\n Bill: Yeah, well it means the infected hear it, too. Let\\'s get in the fucking\\n Bill: Alright, this\\'ll do! Stop!\\n Joel: Just keep it running, alright?\\n Bill: That girl nearly got us killed.\\n Joel: You gotta admit -- she did hold her own back there.\\n Bill: You ain\\'t gonna make it. Oh, oh, ah... Here.\\n Joel: What\\'s this?\\n Bill: You\\'d be amazed at how many cars still got gas in \\'em.\\n Joel: Appreciate it. Look, Bill, um, about your buddy back there. Uh... That\\'s\\n Bill: We square?\\n Joel: We\\'re square.\\n Bill: Then get the fuck outta my town.\\n Ellie: Oh, man.\\n Joel: Hey, what happened to sleeping?\\n Ellie: Okay, I know it doesn\\'t look like it, but this here is not a bad read.\\n Joel: Where did you get that?\\n Ellie: Uhh, back at Bill\\'s. I mean all this stuff was just lying there.\\n Joel: What else did you get?\\n Ellie: Well...\\n Ellie: Here. This make you all nostalgic?\\n Joel: Y\\'know, this is actually before my time. That is a winner though.\\n Joel: Oh, man...\\n Ellie: Well, better than nothing. Oh, I\\'m sure \"your friend\" will be missing\\n Joel: Mm-hmm.\\n Ellie: Light on the reading, but it\\'s got some interesting photos.\\n Joel: Now, Ellie, that ain\\'t for kids.\\n Ellie: Whoa. How...how the hell would he even walk around with that thing?\\n Joel: Get rid of that. Just--\\n Ellie: Hold your horses. I wanna see what all the fuss is about. Oh...why are\\n Joel: Um...\\n Ellie: I\\'m just fucking with you. Bye-bye, dude.\\n Ellie: You know what? This isn\\'t that bad.\\n Joel: Why don\\'t you try and get some sleep, alright?\\n Ellie: Pft -- I\\'m not even tired.\\n Joel: Oh, no, no, no, no. Well, perfect.\\n Ellie: Now what?\\n Joel: Screw it.\\n Ellie: Easy.\\n Man: Please...help...\\n Ellie: Holy shit... Are we going to help him?\\n Joel: Put your seat belt on, Ellie.\\n Man: Help me...\\n Ellie: What about the guy?\\n Joel: Oh, he ain\\'t even hurt.\\n Man: Oh, fuck! Go, go, go!\\n Ellie: Jesus.

Joel!\\n Hunter: I\\'ll show you. I\\'ll show you.\\n Ellie: Get off of me!\\n Ellie: Motherfucker.\\n Joel: Come on.\\n Ellie: What\\'s wrong with these guys?\\n Joel: Catch your breath. We\\'re leaving.\\n Ellie: \\'Kay... Watch out!\\n Joel: Shit! Stay down!\\n Hunter: This motherfucker\\'s dangerous. He killed all of them.\\n Hunter 2: Shit. Spread out.\\n Hunter 3: Damn. This tourist got some scrap in him.\\n Joel: Alright...I think that\\'s the last of \\'em. You OK?\\n Ellie: Yeah. I guess so.\\n Joel: Good, \\'cause we need to get the hell out of here. You know the drill.\\n Ellie: Roger that. Agh. Hey -- maybe we can go through here.\\n Joel: Well, we sure as hell ain\\'t going back this way. Aggh...c\\'mon...Alright,\\n Ellie: Um... There\\'s some pretty gnarly stuff in here.\\n Joel: Ellie!\\n Ellie: Right. Okay, go.\\n Joel: Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.\\n Ellie: Look.\\n Joel: Fucking hunters. See, this could\\'ve been us.\\n Ellie: Man, that is a lot of people that didn\\'t make it.\\n Joel: I knew I should\\'ve turned the damn truck around.\\n Ellie: We lived.\\n Joel: Barely. C\\'mon, let\\'s get outta here.\\n Ellie: How did you know?\\n Joel: Know what?\\n Ellie: About the ambush.\\n Joel: I\\'ve been on both sides.\\n Ellie: Oh. So, ah, you kill a lot of innocent people?\\n Ellie: I\\'ll take that as a yes.\\n Joel: Take it however you want.\\n Ellie: I guess this is where the assholes sleep. I mean slept.\\n Ellie: Oh, I don\\'t think these guys were infected.\\n Joel: It don\\'t matter. Let\\'s just keep moving.\\n Joel: Hey, Ellie, slow down. Wait for me.\\n Ellie: What? I\\'m right here.\\n Joel: How \\'bout you let me go first? And keep your voice down.\\n Ellie: Okay.\\n Ellie: I\\'m whistling.\\n Joel: Oh, good. Something else you can annoy me with.\\n Ellie: That\\'s awesome.\\n Ellie: What happened here? Your fellow hunters do this?\\n Joel: Cute. And no, my money\\'s on the military.\\n Ellie: Why would they mow down all these people?\\n Joel: Can\\'t let everyone in.\\n Ellie: So they killed them?\\n Joel: And dead people don\\'t get infected. You sacrifice the few to save the\\n Ellie: It\\'s kinda shitty.\\n Joel: Yeah.\\n Ellie: What was that?\\n Joel: I don\\'t know. Ellie, get down.\\n Hunter: Where did you learn to shoot?\\n Hunter 2: Man, screw you.\\n Hunter: You had an entire flock and hit nothing.\\n Hunter 2: I\\'m about to hit you.\\n Hunter: Wow...yeah, you\\'re really upset. Well if you want some lessons, I\\'m\\n Hunter 2: Yeah, whatever.\\n Hunter 3: Where the hell are those guys? They\\'re supposed to be here.\\n Hunter: They\\'re on the highway shift. Wouldn\\'t be surprised if they caught\\n Hunter 3: Spot\\'s a goldmine. Lucky bastards.\\n Hunter: See if there\\'s anything you can forage while we wait for them.\\n Hunter 3: Ain\\'t nothin\\' here. Let\\'s keep going.\\n Hunter: Screw this. I ain\\'t waiting any longer. Let\\'s go see what those\\n Hunter 2: They pull this crap every time. I swear to god, if they\\'re holding\\n Hunter: Yeah. And you\\'ll do what?\\n Hunter 2: You\\'ll see.\\n Hunter: Yeah, I will see.\\n Ellie: Hey, we can climb the bus right here. Okay, we need to lighten the\\n Joel: What is that?\\n Ellie: A joke book. No Pun Intended: Volume Too by Will Livingston.\\n Joel: Let\\'s keep going.\\n Ellie: \"What did the Confederate soldiers use to eat off of? Civil ware.\"\\n Joel: Uh-huh.\\n Ellie: \"What did they use to drink with? Cups. Dixie cups.\" \"I walked into my\\n Joel: That\\'s awful.\\n Ellie: You\\'re awful.\\n Joel: Do you even understand what that means?\\n Ellie: Nope. Doesn\\'t matter. Alright, I\\'m done...for now.\\n Ellie: That bridge looks pretty far.\\n Joel: We\\'ll get there.\\n Ellie: Whoa. It\\'s strange seeing a checkpoint with no soldiers.\\n Joel: This is what most zones look like. This place has been abandoned for a\\n Ellie: \"Give us our rations.\" Why wouldn\\'t they give them their food?\\n Joel: Sometimes they ran out. Most times they just held onto it.\\n Ellie: That never happened in Boston.\\n Joel: Trust me, it happened all the time.\\n Ellie: I hear hunters.\\n Joel: Yeah, me too. Let\\'s keep it down while we\\'re going through this area.\\n Hunter: Oh...I\\'m so fucking tired. We were up all night chasing this tourist.\\n Hunter 2: Oh, you were part of that? I heard about this.\\n Hunter: Yeah, this one chick, she would just not give up. I\\'ve never seen\\n Hunter 2: Jesus. Sometimes you gotta earn your keep.\\n Hunter: Yeah, I guess. We were about to give up when she started shooting at\\n Hunter 2: Damn. Maybe you shoulda kept her. Y\\'know, made her one of us.\\n Hunter: No, no way. That girl -- she\\'d a killed us all in our sleep.\\n Hunter 3: Bossman says we\\'re getting big enough to expand.\\n Hunter 4: New head honcho...same bullshit talk.\\n Hunter 3: I don\\'t know. Now that we have enough people watching all the exits,\\n Hunter 4: What is that really gonna give us?\\n Hunter 3 : I don\\'t know, maybe we find some more gas, get some more generators\\n Hunter 4: That shit ain\\'t happening. I\\'ve heard that expansion talk way too\\n Hunter 3: How do you know? Maybe things\\'ll be different now.\\n Hunter 4: Keep your expectations in check, youngun. You\\'ll live longer.\\n Joel: That was too damn close.\\n Ellie: The edge of the universe and back. Endure and survive.\\n Joel: Excuse me?\\n Ellie: Savage Starlight. That comic I\\'ve been reading? It\\'s what the hero says\\n Joel: Endure and survive?\\n Ellie: Yeah.\\n Joel: Okay.\\n Ellie: Man, look at all these books. I wish I had more room in my backpack.\\n Joel: So you\\'re a reader, huh?\\n Ellie: Well, when I\\'m not running away from hunters or infected? Yeah, I read\\n Joel: I get it.\\n Ellie: \"A moon rock tastes better than an earthly rock...because it\\'s meteor.\"\\n Joel: Do you even get that?\\n Ellie: Of course not. \"I used to be addicted to soap, but I\\'m clean now.\"\\n Joel: Alright, I\\'ve actually never heard that one.\\n Ellie: That\\'s it...that\\'s all I got. Now what?\\n Ellie: Man, you\\'d gotta be crazy to string up soldiers.\\n Joel: You get people desperate enough, they\\'ll do just about anything.\\n Ellie: And the people that rose up...they\\'re the ones we\\'ve been fighting here?\\n Joel: That\\'d be my bet. Let\\'s see where this leads us. Watch yourself on these\\n Joel: Down, down, down, down. There\\'s more of \\'em.\\n Hunter: Careful with that plank.\\n Hunter 2: Let\\'s get outta here.\\n Joel: Alright. I don\\'t think they saw us.\\n Ellie: Whew. There\\'s our bridge. We\\'re a little closer, I think.\\n Joel: Let\\'s keep at it. C\\'mon.\\n Ellie: That girl is so skinny. I thought you had plenty of food in your time.\\n Joel: We did. Some just chose to not eat it.\\n Ellie: Why the hell not?\\n Joel: For looks.\\n Ellie: Pssh. That\\'s stupid.\\n Ellie: I think we can use some good ol\\' pun humor. \"3.14% of sailors are pi\\n Joel: 3.14...\\n Ellie: \"I stayed up all night wondering where the sun went. Then it dawned on\\n Joel: I get it.\\n Ellie: \"What did the mermaid wear to her math class?\"\\n Joel: What?\\n Ellie: \"An algae bra.\"\\n Joel: Terrible.\\n Ellie: \"Why did the scarecrow get a promotion?\"\\n Joel: Alright.\\n Ellie: \"Because he was outstanding in his field.\"\\n Joel: That\\'ll do. Put that thing away.\\n Ellie: Okay. I\\'m all joked out.\\n Joel: I can\\'t make that jump.\\n Ellie: If you get me up there, I can move that plank.\\n Joel: Wait here! Let\\'s see where this goes.\\n Joel: What the hell? Oh, this place is bad.\\n Ellie: What the hell was that all about?\\n Joel: Get on. We\\'re cuttin\\' through the hotel.\\n Ellie: Um...okay...\\n Joel: Set that plank like they did.\\n Ellie: Alright. Now you just need to find a way up.\\n Ellie: Oh, this place stinks.\\n Joel: Yeah, wood\\'s all rotten.\\n Ellie: Did you go to coffee shops a lot?\\n Joel: I did. All the time.\\n Ellie: And what would you get?\\n Joel: Just...just coffee.\\n Ellie: Do you think those hunters are gone?\\n Joel: We\\'re about to find out.\\n Joel: It\\'s clear, Ellie. Come on down.\\n Ellie: Whoa...this is fancy. Ever stay in a place like this? Before it all\\n Joel: No...no, this is too rich for my blood.\\n Ellie: Oh. I bet it was nice. I bet we can get up there.\\n Joel: No, it\\'s too high. Let\\'s see what we can find.\\n Joel: Ahhh, I really miss coffee.\\n Ellie: Oh, I\\'ll be checking in for one night and I\\'d like your finest suite\\n Joel: The hell are you doin\\'?\\n Ellie: Why yes, you can take my luggage upstairs.\\n Joel: You are a weird kid.\\n Joel: Come on up. Watch your step.\\n Ellie: Okay, it\\'s time to lighten the mood. \"I tried to catch some fog earlier.\\n Joel: Left?\\n Ellie: Yeah. That\\'s awesome. \"What does a pirate say while eating sushi?\"\\n Joel: I don\\'t know, what?\\n Ellie: \"Ahoy! Pass me some soy!\" I don\\'t get it. \"People are making up\\n Joel: Oh shit. Get down, get down.\\n Hunter: Grr, this tourist put up a hell of a fight. It took two of us to put\\n Hunter 2: Wait, how many is that now?\\n Hunter: Hmm, five just this week. But hey, I\\'m not complaining.\\n Hunter 2: I bet you\\'re not. We done here?\\n Hunter: We got another floor to check, man.\\n Hunter 2: Check for what? I ain\\'t seen a clicker in weeks.\\n Hunter: That\\'s \\'cause we\\'re thorough. We\\'re gonna keep being thorough. Now\\n Hunter 2: Alright, whatever.\\n Hunter 3: Hey, how \\'bout we take a little food break?\\n Hunter 4: Nah, maybe in like an hour or so. We can eat something before heading\\n Hunter 3: Sounds good.\\n Hunter 4: Got some extra dried fruit if you want.\\n Hunter 3: I\\'ll take you up on that.\\n Ellie: Oh, creepy. Guess they took the easy way out, huh?\\n Joel: It ain\\'t easy -- for many it was better than letting a clicker or hunter\\n Joel: Let\\'s see where this goes.\\n Ellie: Just in case.\\n Joel: It\\'s gonna be a tight fit, but come on.\\n Ellie: Okay.\\n Joel: You find something to climb on. Okay, here we go.\\n Ellie: Alright...\\n Joel: Here we go.\\n Ellie: Oh shit! Joel! Joel!\\n Joel: I\\'m alright! Are you okay?\\n Ellie: No! You scared the shit outta me! I\\'m...I\\'m gonna climb down there,\\n Joel: No! Stay up there. I\\'ll make my way up to you!\\n Ellie: Don\\'t do anything stupid!\\n Joel: I\\'ll try.\\n Joel: Maybe that way. That could be it.\\n Joel: Goddamnit. I don\\'t think I tried over there yet.\\n Joel: Over there. I need to find a way around this gate. Well, maybe that\\n Joel: Oh shit.\\n Joel: I hate these things.\\n Joel: Goddammit!\\n Joel: Made it. Ah, so much for that. I gotta find Ellie.\\n Hunter: It\\'s down. Finish it!\\n Hunter 2: I got it.\\n Hunter: Nicely done. You bit?\\n Hunter 2: Not today. You?\\n Hunter: Not today. Alright...spread out and make sure we didn\\'t miss any more\\n Ellie: Man...I shot the hell outta that guy, huh?\\n Joel: Yeah, you sure did.\\n Ellie: I feel sick.\\n Joel: Why didn\\'t you just hang back like I told you to?\\n Ellie: Well, you\\'re glad I didn\\'t, right?\\n Joel: I\\'m glad I didn\\'t get my head blown off by a goddamn kid.\\n Ellie: You know what? No. How about \"Hey, Ellie. I know it wasn\\'t easy, but it\\n Joel: We gotta get going.\\n Ellie: Lead the way.\\n Joel: We need to get back out. Find that bridge.\\n Ellie: Just tell me where to go.\\n Joel: I hate this crap.\\n Ellie: Wow, look at that.\\n Joel: That\\'s a backdrop. People would take their pictures in front of it.\\n Ellie: Yeah, I know what it is.\\n Joel: Okay, then. Something on your mind, Ellie?\\n Ellie: I wasn\\'t trying to disobey you back there. You were taking a really\\n Joel: It don\\'t matter what you thought. I need you to listen to me.\\n Ellie: I do. It\\'s just that... Whatever, Joel.\\n Joel: That door looks like a way out. Hey, you see a way to get up there?\\n Ellie: Nope.\\n Joel: Might be able to get through with this. Alright... Goddamn, this is\\n Ellie: You sure you can trust me with that?\\n Joel: Ellie... Push.\\n Ellie: I am.\\n Joel: Push harder!\\n Ellie: There. How\\'s that?\\n Joel: Let\\'s go.\\n Joel: Oh, shit.\\n Hunter: They haven\\'t gotten back yet. What the hell\\'s taking them so long?\\n Hunter 2: I don\\'t know. They went to check on \\'em. For now, we wait.\\n Joel: C\\'mere, keep your head down. Alright now...I\\'m gonna jump down there and\\n Ellie: What about me?\\n Joel: You stay here.\\n Ellie: This is so stupid. We\\'d have more of a fucking chance if you\\'d let me\\n Joel: I am.\\n Joel: Now you seem to know your way around a gun. You reckon you can handle\\n Ellie: Well, uh, I sorta shot a rifle before...but it was a rats.\\n Joel: Rats?\\n Ellie: With BBs.\\n Joel: Well, it\\'s the same basic concept. Lift it up. Alright now, you\\'re gonna\\n Ellie: Okay.\\n Joel: Go ahead and pull the bolt back. Grab it right there. Just tug it. There\\n Ellie: I got this.\\n Joel: Alright. And just so we\\'re clear about back there...it was either him or\\n Ellie: You\\'re welcome.\\n Hunter: Asshole should\\'ve known better. If you\\'re gonna steal, you better make\\n Hunter 2: Right? I would\\'ve done--\\n Hunter 3: They\\'re all dead! They\\'re all fucking dead!\\n Hunter: The hell\\'s he yappin\\' about? Take a breath. Who\\'s dead?\\n Hunter 3: The whole crew. The 76 lookout guys. Some fuckin\\' tourist killed \\'em,\\n Hunter: Shit. Have you talked to the boss?\\n Hunter 3: Yeah. He wants everyone to hold their ground, watch the gate.\\n Hunter 2: Alright, you heard him. Search the area. Do not let anybody through!\\n Hunter 4: He\\'s gotta be wrong.\\n Hunter 5: About the crew being dead?\\n Hunter 4: I don\\'t see some tourists taking out the entire crew.\\n Hunter 5: What if they did? Maybe it\\'s the military coming back.\\n Hunter 4: Don\\'t be an idiot. Military doesn\\'t give a damn about this place.\\n Hunter 5: We\\'ll find them. We always do.\\n Hunter 4: I hope you\\'re right.\\n Joel: Alright, come on down.\\n Ellie: How\\'d I do?\\n Joel: How \\'bout something a...little more your size.\\n Joel: It\\'s for emergencies only.\\n Ellie: Okay.\\n Joel: Now, the safety\\'s on. Do you know how to switch it off?\\n Ellie: I do.\\n Joel: Okay, you just...you gotta respect it. This is not--\\n Ellie: Joel, I\\'ll be careful.\\n Joel: Okay.\\n Ellie: Whoa, nelly. Harsh punishment.\\n Joel: Shit. It ain\\'t that much different from what the military does back in\\n Ellie: I guess not.\\n Joel: Alright, do your thing, Ellie.\\n Ellie: On it. Come on. Stupid chain is stuck. Hold on.\\n Joel: I am.\\n Ellie: There.\\n Joel: That\\'s good thinkin\\'.\\n Ellie: How \\'bout you get me up there?\\n Joel: Help me open this.\\n Ellie: Here.\\n Joel: I got it.\\n Voice: Run!\\n Joel: Oh shit, get down, get down.\\n Voice: Keep running!\\n Ellie: What do we do?\\n Joel: Nothing.\\n Dying Woman: No...\\n Hunter: Busy couple a days, huh?\\n Hunter 2: Whatever, man. Damn. No food, old pair of shoes. They got nothin\\'.\\n Hunter: Alright.\\n Ellie: Oh man...\\n Joel: There ain\\'t nothin\\' we coulda done.\\n Ellie: I know...it\\'s just...oh man.\\n Joel: Let\\'s just get to that bridge.\\n Ellie: Okay.\\n Hunter: Well, at least they finally killed that couple. I was sure they made\\n Hunter 2: There better\\'ve been an army in that truck. How the fuck did they\\n Hunter: Let\\'s keep searching. I wanna wrap this up by sundown.\\n Hunter: Got word from the east side crew -- they ain\\'t seen shit.\\n Hunter 2: What about Market Street?\\n Hunter: Yeah, they\\'re driving through that area now. Who knows, maybe they\\'ll\\n Hunter 2: I pray to god these tourists show their faces.\\n Hunter: Fuck, they gotta show up somewhere...I think this\\'ll be your lucky day.\\n Ellie: Joel, there\\'s a guy up on that second floor, right there.\\n Joel: Yeah, I see him. Stay low.\\n Ellie: Oh man. Endure and survive.\\n Joel: What? Oh, right...the comic book thing.\\n Ellie: Geez. I guess this is how it ended for this zone.\\n Joel: Well, every battle\\'s got a losing side.\\n Ellie: What if they had families?\\n Joel: Everyone has a family. Best not to dwell on it.\\n Ellie: How can you not? Hey -- get me up there. Come on.\\n Joel: There ya go.\\n Joel: We\\'re almost there.\\n Ellie: I stayed at a place like this. Back in the Boston QZ.\\n Joel: \"Military Preparatory School\".\\n Ellie: Yeah, nice way of saying orphanage. I wonder what happened to all these\\n Joel: This place has been out for a good stretch. They ain\\'t kids no more.\\n Ellie: Meaning they\\'re either hunters trying to kill us, or they\\'re dead.\\n Joel: Or they got away.\\n Ellie: But you don\\'t believe that?\\n Joel: I believe in getting out of this city. Come on.\\n Ellie: There\\'s another one.\\n Ellie: These posters are everywhere.\\n Joel: I saw this right before the outbreak.\\n Ellie: You did? Did he totally gut her by the end?\\n Joel: Nobody gets gutted. It\\'s a dumb teen movie.\\n Ellie: Who dragged you to see it then?\\n Joel: I don\\'t know. Let\\'s just stay focused, alright?\\n Ellie: Alright.\\n Joel: Let\\'s get through the alley.\\n Ellie: Agh, it\\'s that fucking truck.\\n Joel: It\\'s alright, keep your head down.\\n Hunter: Six.\\n Hunter 2: Nope.\\n Hunter: Seven.\\n Hunter 2: Not even close.\\n Hunter: Ten.\\n Hunter 2: Keep going.\\n Hunter: I don\\'t know, twenty.\\n Hunter 2: Try twenty-five.\\n Hunter: Bullshit.\\n Hunter 2: Swear to god.\\n Hunter: You have twenty-five cans of bacon?\\n Hunter 2: Well, twenty-four. I just finished one.\\n Hunter: How the hell do you have twenty-four cans of bacon?\\n Hunter 2: Military locker in the hotel, from back in the day. Me and Reuben\\n Hunter: And that shit\\'s still good? When are you making some more?\\n Hunter 2: Why?\\n Hunter: Why do you think? I want some.\\n Hunter 2: Yeah, I bet you do.\\n Hunter: Man...I saved your ass from that clicker last week.\\n Hunter 2: I\\'ll think about it.\\n Hunter: I shoulda let your ass die back there.\\n Hunter 2: Oh, Jesus. I\\'ll make you some if you quit bringing that up.\\n Hunter: It better be as good as you say it is.\\n Hunter 2: It\\'s bacon; of course it\\'s good.\\n Ellie: What the fuck are they shooting at us with?\\n Joel: I think we lost \\'em.\\n Ellie: Oh shit.\\n Joel: We\\'re okay. They can\\'t see us.\\n Joel: Oh, shit.\\n Man: What the fuck?\\n Joel: Sonofa--\\n Ellie: Joel.\\n Man: Wait. Wait!\\n Ellie: Joel, stop! Look.\\n Man: Leave him alone.\\n Joel: Easy, on. Just take it easy.\\n Man: It\\'s alright. They\\'re not the bad guys. Lower the gun. Man, you hit hard.\\n Joel: Yeah, well, I was trying to kill you.\\n Man: Yeah, I thought you were one of them too. Then I saw you. If you haven\\'t\\n Kid: You\\'re bleeding.\\n Man: Ah, it\\'s nothing.\\n Henry: I\\'m Henry. This is Sam. I think I caught your name was Joel?\\n Ellie: Ellie.\\n Joel: How many are with you?\\n Sam: They\\'re all dead.\\n Henry: Hey, we don\\'t know that. There were a bunch of us. Someone had the\\n Ellie: We can help each other.\\n Joel: Ellie.\\n Ellie: Safety in numbers and all that.\\n Henry: She\\'s right. We could help each other. We got a hideout not too far\\n Joel: Alright, take us there.\\n Henry: Follow me.\\n Sam: Sorry about the whole gun thing.\\n Ellie: Don\\'t worry. I would\\'ve probably done the same thing. Where you from?\\n Sam: All the way from Hartford.\\n Ellie: Really? I heard some bad stuff going on down there.\\n Sam: Yeah, the military abandoned the zone. It\\'s why we left. Place probably\\n Henry: We gotta be careful. We\\'re right next to one of their lookout areas. Is\\n Ellie: We\\'re not related, we\\'re more like, um...\\n Joel: I promised someone I\\'d look after her.\\n Henry: Yeah, I can appreciate that.\\n Henry: Wait, wait. Everyone be quiet. Get away from the windows.\\n Joel: They\\'re gone.\\n Henry: Man...that fuckin\\' truck. It\\'s been hounding us ever since we got in\\n Sam: Nothing.\\n Henry: Get rid of it.\\n Sam: My backpack is practically empty.\\n Henry: What\\'s the rule about takin\\' stuff?\\n Sam: It weighs like nothing.\\n Henry: The rule -- what is it?\\n Sam: We only take what we have to.\\n Henry: That\\'s right. Now come on.\\n Joel: How far is this place?\\n Henry: We\\'re close. Real close.\\n Joel: Shit. Ellie, you watch our back.\\n Ellie: Of course.\\n Henry: Sam, stay with her.\\n Hunter: What\\'d you find?\\n Hunter 2: Nothing... Looks like someone was up there, but they\\'re long gone.\\n Hunter: So where are the others?\\n Hunter 2: They wanted to give it another once over. Make sure we didn\\'t miss\\n Hunter: Alright...keep an eye out over there. I\\'ll check this area.\\n Henry: We did it. Not bad, old timer. Come on, up on this truck. Oh shit,\\n Henry: Through this door.\\n Joel: Are you sure it\\'s safe being so close to them?\\n Henry: I\\'m the only one with the key, man.\\n Joel: And where\\'d you get that?\\n Henry: I killed one of \\'em. He won\\'t miss it now. Everybody through.\\n Sam: It\\'s back here. So...how old are you?\\n Ellie: Me? Fourteen. How old are you?\\n Sam: Ah...the same.\\n Henry: Oh, you\\'re fourteen, huh?\\n Sam: I\\'m close.\\n Henry: Alright.\\n Sam: I am.\\n Henry: Here we are.

Check this out.\\n Henry: Look at these sons of bitches. Everyday they congregate down there,\\n Joel: That could work.\\n Henry: Oh, it\\'ll work. It\\'ll definitely work. Wow...\\n Sam: Ready?\\n Ellie: Ow.\\n Sam: A blueberry hurt you?\\n Henry: It\\'s been awhile since that boy even cracked a smile. She doesn\\'t seem\\n Joel: So where were you headin\\'?\\n Henry: Heard the Fireflies are based out west somewhere. We\\'re gonna join up\\n Joel: Yeah...\\n Henry: Somethin\\' funny?\\n Joel: Just seems like there\\'s a lot of people putting their stock on the\\n Henry: Yeah, maybe there\\'s a reason for that.\\n Joel: So you don\\'t know where they are and you\\'re just gonna drag him across\\n Henry: I tell you what, how about I worry about my brother and you worry about\\n Joel: Easy. We\\'re looking for the Fireflies too.\\n Henry: This is us. There\\'s an abandoned military radio station, just outside\\n Joel: I guess we best rest up then.\\n Ellie: He says it\\'s time to go.\\n Henry: Now, we\\'re gonna be moving fast, okay?

Hey, I\\'ll follow your lead.\\n Joel: Alright.\\n Hunter: Hey...how you doing?\\n Hunter 2: Just trying to keep warm. How\\'s it looking out there?\\n Hunter: We put down some infected, but no sign of those tourists.\\n Hunter 2: Think they\\'re still in the city?\\n Hunter: Yeah, they\\'re still around. Alright...I\\'m gonna do another round.\\n Hunter 2: Yeah, you too.\\n Hunter: Hey, you hear that? Clicker.\\n Hunter 2: Yeah, I hear it, but I don\\'t see shit! Woo! Nailed it! Did you see\\n Hunter: Not bad. Hold up, there it is! There!\\n Henry: Yo, Joel, there\\'s a guy on that light up there.\\n Joel: I see \\'em.\\n Henry: Alright, we did it.\\n Joel: Henry, give me a hand with this.\\n Henry: Alright. You ready?\\n Henry: Ah, shit. Go!\\n Joel: Oh, no. Hurry, c\\'mon.\\n Henry: Wait, wait, wait!\\n Hunter: Hey! They\\'re over here!\\n Henry: Got \\'em.

Okay...\\n Joel: Go...\\n Ellie: Oh, fuck.\\n Hunter: Go around to the other side!\\n Ellie: Agh. How the fuck do we get outta here?\\n Hunter: The hell is going on back there?\\n Hunter 2: Sounds like they found \\'em. Spread out. They might come through here.\\n Joel: Alright, let\\'s get underneath it.\\n Hunter: Fuckin\\' open it! Go! There! They\\'re running to the bridge! Go, go, go!\\n Ellie: Joel!\\n Joel: Oh, shit.\\n Ellie: Oh, fuck.\\n Joel: How many bullets do you have left?\\n Ellie: They\\'re gonna kill us.\\n Joel: What other choice do we have?\\n Ellie: We jump.\\n Joel: No, it\\'s too high and you can\\'t swim. I\\'ll boost you up, you run past\\n Ellie: Oh, shit.\\n Joel: Oh my god.\\n Ellie: You\\'ll keep me afloat.\\n Joel: Ellie.\\n Ellie: No time to argue.\\n Joel: Ellie!

Everything\\'s fine. You know,\\n Henry: What the fuck\\'s wrong with you?\\n Sam: Henry!\\n Joel: Get back, son!\\n Henry: It\\'s fine! Hey, hey, hey, hey... He\\'s pissed but he\\'s not gonna do\\n Joel: You sure about that?\\n Sam: Stop!\\n Ellie: Joel.\\n Joel: He left us to die out there.\\n Henry: No. You had a good chance of making it, and you did. But coming back\\n Ellie: He saved me too. We woulda drowned.\\n Henry: It\\'s fine though. I\\'m okay. Y\\'know, for what it\\'s worth, I\\'m really\\n Ellie: That was intense. You cool?\\n Joel: Yeah. Let\\'s go find that radio tower.\\n Ellie: For a second there, I thought you might shoot him.\\n Joel: Yeah...almost did.\\n Ellie: They\\'re alright. I think it\\'s good to have \\'em around.\\n Joel: I think you\\'re right.\\n Sam: Um, do you trust him?\\n Henry: Yeah, I do. Hey, don\\'t worry about it. We\\'re fine now, okay?\\n Sam: Yeah.\\n Henry: You gotta believe me on this, Sam, alright?\\n Sam: Sure.\\n Ellie: Hey, maybe we can find something in that boat over there.\\n Henry: Keep your eyes peeled!\\n Joel: Way ahead of you, kid.\\n Ellie: Whoa.\\n Joel: What?\\n Ellie: First time on a boat.\\n Joel: Well, it\\'s a little bit different in the water.\\n Ellie: One step at a time.\\n Sam: Hey, Ellie. I think we found something!\\n Ellie: Let\\'s go see what it is.\\n Henry: Hey, I bet this goes all the way through. Gimme a hand with this.\\n Joel: Alright, same time. Come on.\\n Henry: Let\\'s do it.\\n Joel: Alright, c\\'mon, kids, go.\\n Henry: Alright. Here we go.\\n Joel: You go in.\\n Henry: Okay.\\n Henry: Hey, flashlights out. Sam, stay--\\n Sam: Stay close, I know.\\n Henry: Someone\\'s finally learning.\\n Ellie: See anything?\\n Joel: Uh-huh. Gotta find a different way.\\n Ellie: Joel, we should see what\\'s over here.\\n Joel: It\\'s blocked.\\n Ellie: If you can get it open, I can crawl through and clear that door. Oh,\\n Ellie: Do you think they\\'ll join us all the way to Tommy\\'s?\\n Joel: Well, I don\\'t know. We\\'re just gonna have to see how everything pans out.\\n Henry: This way. Yeah, looks like there\\'s a path up ahead. Right here.\\n Sam: Can we get out this way?\\n Sam: Well, I can\\'t swim.\\n Ellie: That makes two of us.\\n Henry: Alright, Joel, how do we get across?\\n Joel: Guess we gotta figure somethin\\' out.\\n Henry: Hey, this thing\\'s on some kinda track. Maybe there\\'s a way we can use\\n Ellie: Look, a generator.\\n Henry: It\\'s jammed!\\n Joel: Henry, give it a shot!\\n Henry: Alright! Here we go. Yep -- it\\'s working!\\n Joel: I\\'ll go have a look. You keep an eye out.\\n Henry: Joel! You okay?\\n Joel: Yeah! Still in one piece.\\n Ellie: Oh -- this thing again.\\n Henry: Oh, there you go. That\\'s smart.\\n Ellie: Ahh, I can\\'t wait to get outta this place.\\n Joel: Alright, see if that generator\\'s still got some juice.\\n Ellie: Here goes nothin\\'. Alright!\\n Sam: Huh. I can\\'t believe that actually worked.\\n Henry: Yeah, don\\'t jinx us.\\n Henry: I gotta say, I\\'m impressed with you two.\\n Ellie: Pssh...we\\'re pros at this by now.\\n Ellie: Uh...what\\'s up with this?\\n Sam: You think there\\'s people inside?\\n Henry: Maybe.\\n Ellie: Are we really going in there?\\n Joel: Oh shit.\\n Henry: Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\n Sam: It\\'s a sound trap.\\n Ellie: A what?\\n Joel: It\\'s a sort of alarm.\\n Ellie: I don\\'t hear anything.\\n Joel: Someone used to live here. Don\\'t look like that\\'s the case anymore.\\n Sam: Who would stay in here?\\n Henry: Well, someone who thought they could keep a place like this safe.\\n Joel: Ugh.\\n Ellie: Oh, awesome.\\n Joel: Ellie, don\\'t--\\n Ellie: Ah, calm down. Sam, stand by those posts over there. Yeah.\\n Sam: Okay.\\n Ellie: Ready?\\n Sam: Oh, Henry, did you see that?\\n Henry: Let\\'s keep it down, buddy, okay?\\n Sam: Yeah. Sorry.\\n Ellie: You hear that? Infected.\\n Joel: Shh, shhh. Quiet.\\n Henry: There\\'s three more heading our way!\\n Ellie: Well, I guess we know what happened to these people.\\n Joel: Seeing as how there was a clicker, they must\\'ve been gone for awhile.\\n Henry: We keep moving forward. All we can do is hope that there aren\\'t any\\n Ellie: Hey. You think that leads out?\\n Henry: Could be. It\\'s too high for a boost. Maybe there\\'s another way to get\\n Joel: Oh shit. Get back!\\n Ellie: What?\\n Henry: Sam!\\n Sam: Yeah, I\\'m cool.\\n Joel: That was me. I must\\'ve triggered some sort of safety gate or somethin\\'.\\n Ellie: So...this is awkward.\\n Sam: Yeah, I know. It\\'s like every time--\\n Ellie: Clickers!\\n Joel: What?\\n Henry: Hey, this thing isn\\'t budging, man.\\n Joel: Just go, get outta here.\\n Henry: Sam, you stay close to him.\\n Ellie: Henry, we gotta fucking move!\\n Henry: You keep him safe!\\n Joel: Go! Shh, shh, shh.\\n Joel: We\\'re gonna be fine.\\n Henry: Yeah, yeah I know.\\n Joel: Alright, come on, kid. See if we can find a way outta here, yeah?\\n Henry: Okay.\\n Sam: You did it.\\n Joel: We\\'re gonna keep going. You good?\\n Sam: Yeah. I bet there were a lot of them here. People, I mean.\\n Joel: Looks like it.\\n Sam: Look at this place. It\\'s like a classroom. Why couldn\\'t they keep it safe?\\n Joel: Son, I wish I knew. God knows they didn\\'t deserve it. You think you can\\n Sam: Yeah.\\n Joel: Go ahead.\\n Sam: There we go.\\n Joel: Good job, kid.\\n Ellie: Fucking thing!\\n Sam: Is that Ellie?\\n Joel: C\\'mon.\\n Sam: Joel, that\\'s them.\\n Henry: Sam!\\n Ellie: Oh thank god. We gotta keep running.\\n Henry: Doorway -- over there! Sam!\\n Ellie: Run! There\\'s too many of \\'em!\\n Joel: Ellie! Get away from the door!\\n Henry: Maybe if we push it together.\\n Ellie: Sam! He just crawled through!\\n Henry: He what? Sam, what the hell are you doin\\'?\\n Sam: Getting us outta here!\\n Henry: Well, hurry up then!\\n Joel: Alright, go.\\n Henry: Everyone, upstairs. Let\\'s go!\\n Henry: Damn thing\\'s stuck!\\n Ellie: Gimme a boost! I can get through that window.\\n Henry: Open it from the other side.\\n Joel: Make it fast!\\n Henry: C\\'mon, Sam, you\\'re not staying in here.\\n Sam: What about you?\\n Henry: I\\'ll be fine. C\\'mon. Go.\\n Joel: Get ready!\\n Henry: Fuck. Here we go!\\n Ellie: We got it!\\n Joel: Alright, move! Let\\'s go, let\\'s go!\\n Henry: Fresh air...\\n Joel: Oh...\\n Ellie: Wha--\\n Sam: Look at this.\\n Ellie: Oh, are you fucking kidding me? Thanks for the warning on the other\\n Joel: So, where\\'s this tower?\\n Henry: We\\'re close. C\\'mon, let\\'s go. Hey. How you doin\\', little man?\\n Sam: That was a close one, huh?\\n Henry: Yeah. Not one of our finest moments, but we made it out.\\n Sam: Yeah.\\n Henry: Hey, look at that. Yep, what\\'d I tell you, huh?\\n Joel: Let\\'s find a way around to it. What about you, how you holdin\\' up?\\n Ellie: Business as usual, right? When I was with Henry, I took out a couple of\\n Joel: Yeah.\\n Sam: It was pretty intense back there, huh?\\n Ellie: Yeah. Totally.\\n Sam: How\\'d you two end up together?\\n Ellie: Oh...a friend of mine, Marlene, asked him to take me to the Fireflies.\\n Sam: You seem to get along well.\\n Ellie: Yeah, well...now I just boss him around. Isn\\'t that right, Joel?\\n Ellie: What was this place like without infected? Tsh...I can\\'t even imagine\\n Sam: \"Will shoot on sight.\" Lots of friendly people lived here.\\n Henry: First few months after the outbreak, they had a lot of lootin\\'.\\n Joel: Everyone barricaded themselves in their homes, then supplies started\\n Henry: I was just five when the cordyceps hit. My memory\\'s pretty hazy, but I\\n Ellie: What do you remember?\\n Henry: Uhh...barbecues. Parents, they would throw these crazy big barbecues\\n Ellie: Oh. Doggies.\\n Joel: You\\'re gonna want to stay away from those. It\\'s not like it is in the\\n Ellie: What is this?\\n Sam: Oh, this is an ice cream truck.\\n Ellie: An ice cream truck?\\n Sam: Yeah, Henry told me about these. They\\'d sell ice cream out of the truck.\\n Ellie: What? No way. Joel?\\n Joel: It\\'s true. This thing would drive around and play real loud, creepy\\n Ellie: You\\'re totally fucking with me.\\n Joel: Um-mmm. Serious.\\n Ellie: Man, you lived in a strange time.\\n Sam: Told you so.\\n Ellie: Agghh...is anybody else hungry?\\n Sam: Yes.\\n Henry: Hey guys -- we break when we get to the radio tower.\\n Sam: Alright.\\n Sam: Darts.\\n Ellie: Right.\\n Henry: Hey, Sam...be careful.\\n Sam: Yeah...okay. Alright, I\\'ll go first. Damn it.\\n Ellie: Oh.\\n Sam: Alright, your turn.\\n Ellie: Okay. Just throw it?\\n Sam: Yeah.\\n Ellie: Boosh, I am a natural.\\n Sam: Luck.\\n Ellie: No it wasn\\'t.\\n Sam: That was luck.\\n Ellie: Alright, get outta here. You\\'re getting cocky. Here we go. Fuck.\\n Sam: Horrible.\\n Ellie: Alright...it\\'s a tie.\\n Sam: No, no, you clearly got destroyed.\\n Ellie: How did I clearly get destroyed? That\\'s practically a tie!\\n Sam: Yeah, okay.\\n Henry: There\\'ll come a day when kids can just be kids again.\\n Joel: Let\\'s go.\\n Henry: Fireflies were here.\\n Joel: Yeah, by the looks of it.\\n Sam: How\\'re we gonna find them?\\n Joel: I know a guy. My brother, actually. He was a Firefly. Last I heard he\\n Henry: Sounds like a good plan, man.\\n Ellie: Ah, okay. You guys are killing me with your downer talk. It\\'s joke\\n Sam: What is that?\\n Ellie: Just bear with me. \"You wanna hear a joke about pizza? Never mind, it\\n Sam: I don\\'t get it.\\n Ellie: Yeah, me neither. \"What did the green grape say to purple grape?\\n Sam: That\\'s so stupid. Alright, I got a joke for you.\\n Ellie: Let\\'s hear it.\\n Sam: Why can\\'t your nose be twelve inches long?\\n Ellie: I don\\'t know, why?\\n Sam: Because...then it would be a foot.\\n Ellie: That\\'s so dumb. I love it.\\n Joel: Oh shit! Get down.\\n Ellie: Oh shit...\\n Henry: Fuckin\\' sniper... Did you see where it came from?\\n Joel: Somewhere down the street. Alright now...y\\'all stay here.\\n Ellie: No.\\n Joel: Before you start -- I need you guys to keep him busy. I\\'m gonna go\\n Ellie: Okay. Hey. Be careful.\\n Joel: Come on, guys... Oh, no, no, no.\\n Hunter: It\\'s those damn tourists from the city.\\n Joel: Come on, Henry.\\n Hunter 2: Thought you could get away from us, huh?\\n Hunter: We\\'re back, motherfucker!\\n Ellie: Shit! Oh, that was so intense!\\n Henry: You alright Sam?\\n Sam: Yeah, I\\'m okay.\\n Ellie: Thanks, Joel.\\n Henry: Alright. We did it.\\n Ellie: We should move.\\n Sam: Henry!\\n Joel: Shit.\\n Henry: Sam, are you okay?\\n Sam: Yeah. Yeah, I\\'m fine.\\n Henry: You sure? You seem funny.\\n Ellie: C\\'mon, c\\'mon.\\n Henry: Let\\'s move!\\n Joel: Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh god...\\n Ellie: Joel, you\\'re okay.\\n Joel: Still here. Anybody hurt?\\n Sam: Uh-uh.\\n Henry: No, we\\'re good.\\n Joel: Alright, I think it\\'s time we quit this place. C\\'mon.\\n Henry: Let\\'s go.\\n Henry: Shut the hell up.\\n Joel: Dead serious. It was Tommy\\'s birthday. That\\'s all he wanted to do is\\n Henry: Ah, man. I could die happy if I could just drive one around the block.\\n Joel: It was good. It was real good.\\n Henry: Good? Can you believe this guy? C\\'mon, man, gimme details. Describe it.\\n Ellie: You know what? You two deserve a little privacy.\\n Henry: No, no, Ellie, Ellie, this isn\\'t just any regular motorcycle, okay? You\\n Ellie: Oh yeah? How would you know?\\n Henry: I\\'ve seen it in my dreams... Vroom, vroom, vroom...\\n Ellie: Okay.\\n Henry: I don\\'t think anyone from our group\\'s gonna show up.\\n Joel: Yeah.\\n Henry: Worst part about it all -- explaining it to Sam.\\n Ellie: Well, it\\'s safe to say those two have officially bonded. What\\'re you\\n Sam: Taking stock of all the food we found today.\\n Ellie: I see... And how are we doing on canned peaches?\\n Sam: Did Henry send you?\\n Ellie: No. Why would Henry send me?\\n Sam: To make sure I\\'m not fucking up somehow.\\n Ellie: Psshhh. I\\'d say we all did pretty good back there -- especially you.\\n Sam: Well...\\n Ellie: Is everything alright?\\n Sam: Everything\\'s fine.\\n Ellie: Okay... Well... Have a good night.\\n Sam: How is it that you\\'re never scared?\\n Ellie: Who says that I\\'m not?\\n Sam: What\\'re you scared of?\\n Ellie: Let\\'s see...scorpions are pretty creepy. Um...being by myself. I\\'m\\n Sam: Those things out there. What if the people are still inside? What if\\n Ellie: Okay, first of all, we\\'re a team now. We\\'re gonna help each other out.\\n Sam: Henry says that, \"they\\'ve moved on\". That they\\'re with their families.\\n Ellie: I go back and forth. I mean, I\\'d like to believe it.\\n Sam: But you don\\'t.\\n Ellie: I guess not.\\n Sam: Yeah...me neither.\\n Ellie: Oh...all this serious talk, I almost forgot.\\n Ellie: There. If he doesn\\'t know about it, he can\\'t take it away. Alright, I\\'m\\n Ellie: Damn. That smells good.\\n Joel: Good morning.\\n Ellie: Where\\'s Sam?\\n Henry: I let him sleep in for once.\\n Ellie: Oh.\\n Henry: Well if you want him to join us, you can go wake his ass up.\\n Ellie: Okay.\\n Ellie: Sam? Sam!\\n Joel: What the hell?\\n Joel: Shit! He\\'s turnin\\'!\\n Henry: That\\'s my fucking brother!\\n Ellie: Sam!\\n Joel: Screw it!\\n Ellie: Oh, shit...\\n Joel: Ellie? Ellie, are you alright?\\n Ellie: Uh-huh. Oh my god.\\n Henry: Sam?\\n Ellie: Oh no...\\n Henry: Sam...\\n Joel: Henry. Ellie, stay here. Henry.\\n Henry: Henry, what have you done?\\n Joel: I\\'m gonna get that gun from you, okay?\\n Henry: Sa...Sa...Sam...\\n Joel: Whoa. Okay, okay, easy.\\n Henry: It\\'s your fault.\\n Joel: This is nobody\\'s fault, Henry.\\n Henry: It\\'s all your fault!\\n Joel: Henry! Henry, no...\\n Ellie: Oh my god.\\n Ellie: Jackson County. That means we\\'re close to Jackson City, right?\\n Joel: Shouldn\\'t be more than a few miles.\\n Ellie: You ready to see your dear old brother?\\n Joel: I\\'m just ready to get there.\\n Ellie: You nervous?\\n Joel: I don\\'t know what I\\'m feeling.\\n Ellie: So much for this road.\\n Joel: We just follow the river. It\\'ll lead us straight to Tommy\\'s. C\\'mon.\\n Ellie: What happened between you two?\\n Joel: What do you mean?\\n Ellie: You and Tommy...you\\'re not together, so clearly something went down.\\n Joel: We just had a bit of a disagreement, that\\'s all.\\n Ellie: Oh, here we go...so what was it about?\\n Joel: Tommy saw the world one way, I saw it the other.\\n Ellie: And that\\'s why he joined the Fireflies?\\n Joel: Yeah, your friend Marlene promised him hope. That kept him busy for\\n Ellie: How was it, the last time you saw him?\\n Joel: I believe his last words to me were \"I don\\'t ever want to see your god\\n Ellie: Geez. But he\\'s gonna help us?\\n Joel: I suppose we\\'re gonna find out.\\n Ellie: Well, with or without his help, we\\'ll get there.\\n Joel: Let\\'s just keep going.\\n Ellie: Whoa, what\\'s that?\\n Joel: That there is a hydroelectric power plant.\\n Ellie: A...hydra who?\\n Joel: It, uh...uses the river\\'s movement and turns it into electricity.\\n Ellie: How\\'s it do that?\\n Joel: Look. I know what it is, I don\\'t know how it does it.\\n Ellie: Alright...how are we getting across?\\n Ellie: Well, that gets us halfway. If we get the other one up, we\\'ll make it\\n Joel: Alright, Ellie, I need you to--\\n Ellie: I know, step on the fucking pallet.\\n Joel: Go on, give it a spin.\\n Ellie: Hey, be careful crossing that thing.\\n Joel: I will.\\n Ellie: Teamwork.\\n Ellie: Yeah.\\n Joel: That\\'s too small of a grave.\\n Ellie: I forgot to leave that stupid robot on his grave. What should I do with\\n Joel: Ellie...\\n Ellie: What? I want to talk about it.\\n Joel: No.\\n Ellie: Why not?\\n Joel: How many times do we need to go over this? Things happen...and we move\\n Ellie: It\\'s just--\\n Joel: That\\'s enough.\\n Ellie: You\\'re right. I\\'m sorry.\\n Joel: Let\\'s get to Tommy\\'s.\\n Ellie: Aughh, I\\'m so hungry.\\n Joel: I know, I am too.\\n Ellie: Alright, next squirrel I see, I\\'m totally shooting it.\\n Joel: Let\\'s get past this place, then we can scrounge up some food.\\n Ellie: Well, if I starve, you\\'re responsible.\\n Ellie: Uh...should we head in?\\n Joel: Ah, ain\\'t no way around... Gonna have to cut through the plant.\\n Woman: Don\\'t even think about reaching for your weapon. Tell the girl to drop\\n Joel: Ellie, do as the lady says.\\n Ellie: Okay.\\n Woman: Please tell me you\\'re lost.\\n Joel: We didn\\'t know the place was occupied. We\\'re just trying to make our way\\n Woman: Through to where?\\n Voice: They\\'re alright.\\n Woman: What, you know these people?\\n Voice: I know him.\\n Tommy: He\\'s my goddamn brother.\\n Joel: Tommy.\\n Tommy: Holy shit.\\n Joel: How you doin\\', baby brother?\\n Tommy: Goddamn.\\n Joel: Yeah.\\n Tommy: Let me look at you. You got fucking old.\\n Joel: Easy -- it\\'s gonna happen to you too.\\n Tommy: This is Maria. Be nice to her, she sorta runs things around here.\\n Joel: Ma\\'am. Thanks for not blowing my head off.\\n Maria: Would\\'ve been embarrassing, considering you\\'re my brother-in-law.\\n Tommy: We all gotta get wrangled up at some point.\\n Maria: Ellie, right?\\n Ellie: Yeah.\\n Maria: What brings you through here?\\n Ellie: Uh...it\\'s kind of a long story.\\n Tommy: Why don\\'t we bring \\'em inside?\\n Maria: Yeah. You hungry?\\n Ellie: Starving.\\n Maria: False alarm. They\\'re friendlies. We\\'ve been dealing with raids. Lot of\\n Tommy: It\\'s been quiet for a few days.\\n Joel: What the hell are you doin\\' here? I thought I\\'d find you in Jackson.\\n Tommy: Been trying to bring the plant back to life.\\n Maria: We had it working before, but one of the turbines went south.\\n Tommy: We have electricity, Joel...had. We\\'ll get it running again.\\n Ellie: No way. You guys have horses.\\n Tommy: We got a whole lot of \\'em.\\n Man: Hey, Tommy, gimme a hand with this.\\n Tommy: Sorry. I\\'ll be right back.\\n Ellie: Can I?\\n Maria: Yeah, of course. He likes when you pet his ears. You ever ride one?\\n Ellie: I actually have.\\n Joel: When have you ridden a horse?\\n Ellie: Winston, this soldier back in the zone. He gave me lessons.\\n Maria: You know, if you want, we can take him riding later.\\n Ellie: That\\'d be awesome.\\n Tommy: There!\\n Man: Hey thanks, Tommy.\\n Tommy: No sweat. All right, let\\'s continue the tour.\\n Maria: Earl?\\n Earl: Yeah?\\n Maria: Why are you here?

Go with Maria and put some food in you.\\n Ellie: Joel?\\n Maria: C\\'mon, Ellie. Let\\'s give the boys some space. I\\'m sending Tommy over.\\n Tommy: This\\'ll be the sixth time of them trying to get the turbines back\\n Tommy: It\\'s a little faded but it still looks pretty good.\\n Joel: I\\'m good.\\n Tommy: You sure?

This place gives \\'em a second chance. It gives us all\\n Joel: I\\'ve been on quite the adventure, little brother.\\n Tommy: I reckon it\\'s got something to do with that girl.\\n Joel: Oh, it\\'s got everything to do with that little girl.\\n Tommy: Well, go on then.\\n Joel: She\\'s immune.\\n Tommy: Immune to what? Oh, c\\'mon.\\n Joel: See, I know...I\\'ve seen her breathe enough spores to take down a dozen\\n Tommy: Alright. I\\'ll bite. Why bring her here?\\n Joel: I was supposed to deliver her to the Fireflies... The way I figured it,\\n Tommy: I haven\\'t seen a Firefly in years.\\n Joel: But you know where they are. Now I\\'m not asking for much, Tommy. I just\\n Tommy: What makes you think I\\'d do this for you?\\n Joel: This isn\\'t for me, Tommy. This is for your damn cause.\\n Tommy: My cause is my family now. You ain\\'t talking about some walk in the\\n Joel: Jesus, boy...have Maria get some of your born again friends to do it.\\n Tommy: They got families too.\\n Joel: Tommy, I need this.\\n Tommy: You want some gear, sure. But I ain\\'t taking that girl off your hands.\\n Joel: This is how you gonna repay me...huh?\\n Tommy: Repay you?\\n Joel: For all those goddamn years I took care of us.\\n Tommy: Took care? That\\'s what you call it? I got nothing but nightmares from\\n Joel: You survived because of me.\\n Tommy: It wasn\\'t worth it.\\n Joel: I bring you the cure for mankind and you wanna play the pissy little\\n Tommy: We ain\\'t back in Boston. You lay your hands on me again it won\\'t end\\n Joel: The hell is that?\\n Tommy: We\\'re under attack. You still remember how to kill, right?\\n Joel: Yeah...\\n Man: Shit! Bandits!\\n Man 2: Stop \\'em! Don\\'t let them into the building.\\n Tommy: Let\\'s get a move on!\\n Tommy: You guys see anything?\\n Man 2: We got \\'em.\\n Tommy: Let\\'s get to the bridge.\\n Maria: Tommy! Bandits, they\\'re breaking into the building.\\n Tommy: Can you get out of there?\\n Maria: No, we\\'re trapped.\\n Tommy: We\\'re gonna come to you, just stay--\\n Maria: They\\'re here.

They were coming in from every direction--\\n Joel: Okay.\\n Ellie: --then Maria was like \"We gotta run!\"--\\n Joel: Listen.\\n Ellie: --and so we dove over these tables and this huge guy blasts in with a\\n Joel: Slow down, slow down. Listen--\\n Ellie: And then--\\n Joel: Hey, hey, are you hurt?\\n Ellie: No.\\n Tommy: Goddamnit. I need to talk to you.\\n Maria: Absolutely not. You tell him to go find somebody else.\\n Tommy: Maria, I can\\'t have this hanging over my head.\\n Maria: Do you have any idea how many men we lost here today?\\n Ellie: Hey, what\\'s that all about? Does that have anything to do with me?\\n Joel: We\\'ll talk about it later.\\n Ellie: Did he tell you where the lab is?\\n Joel: We\\'ll talk about it later.\\n Ellie: Later... Right.\\n Maria: It takes one. One fuck up. One fuck up and then I turn into one of\\n Tommy: I have to do this. I don\\'t know what else to say.\\n Maria: Fine.\\n Tommy: Maria.

If anything -- anything at all happens to him, it\\'s on you.\\n Tommy: She\\'s thankful, you know.\\n Joel: Yeah, I know.\\n Tommy: I\\'ll take that girl of yours to the Fireflies. You don\\'t have to worry\\n Joel: It\\'s best this way.\\n Tommy: Maybe some real good will come of this.\\n Joel: I need to talk to Ellie.\\n Tommy: Say again, I didn\\'t hear ya. Joel!\\n Joel: What, what is it?\\n Tommy: That girl of yours, she took one of our horses and rode off.\\n Joel: Damn it. Which way?\\n Tommy: C\\'mon.\\n Man: I saw her riding on outta here.\\n Tommy: Go back inside. Help the others clean the place up.\\n Man: Okay. Be careful out there.\\n Joel: Easy, easy.\\n Tommy: There.\\n Joel: Yeah.\\n Tommy: See the tracks? C\\'mon.\\n Tommy: She couldn\\'t have gotten far. We\\'ll find her. Don\\'t worry.\\n Joel: Stubborn kid.\\n Tommy: She usually pull these stunts?\\n Joel: Nothing like this. I don\\'t know what\\'s going on.\\n Tommy: She didn\\'t go down this way. Horse tracks. She went into these woods.\\n Joel: Ellie, what\\'re you thinking? There. More tracks.\\n Tommy: Okay, good.\\n Joel: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\\n Tommy: I got your back. How many do you see?\\n Joel: Too goddamn many.\\n Tommy: Go around. I\\'ll cover you.\\n Tommy: That\\'s all of \\'em.\\n Joel: C\\'mon. Back to the horses.\\n Joel: Tracks keep going this way. Just hope they didn\\'t get to her.\\n Tommy: Look, by the ranch. That\\'s our horse. She\\'s gotta be there.\\n Joel: Area looks clear.\\n Tommy: Be careful.\\n Joel: Ellie? Ellie?!\\n Ellie: I\\'m up here.\\n Joel: Jesus Christ.\\n Tommy: I\\'ll keep an eye out. Reckon you guys need to have a chat.\\n Ellie: Is this really all they had to worry about? Boys. Movies. Deciding\\n Joel: Get up, we\\'re leaving. C\\'mon.\\n Ellie: And if I say no?\\n Joel: Do you even realize what your life means? Huh? Running off like that.\\n Ellie: Well, I guess we\\'re both disappointed with each other then.\\n Joel: What do you want from me?\\n Ellie: Admit that you wanted to get rid of me the whole time.\\n Joel: Tommy knows this area better than--\\n Ellie: Agh, fuck that.\\n Joel: Well, I\\'m sorry, I trust him better than I trust myself.\\n Ellie: Stop with the bullshit. What are you so afraid of? That I\\'m gonna end\\n Joel: How many close calls have we had?\\n Ellie: Well, we seem to be doing alright so far.\\n Joel: And now you\\'ll be doing even better with Tommy.\\n Ellie: I\\'m not her, you know.\\n Joel: What?\\n Ellie: Maria told me about Sarah. And I--\\n Joel: Ellie. You are treading on some mighty thin ice here.\\n Ellie: I\\'m sorry about your daughter, Joel, but I have lost people too.\\n Joel: You have no idea what loss is.\\n Ellie: Everyone I have cared for has either died or left me. Everyone fucking\\n Joel: You\\'re right... You\\'re not my daughter, and I sure as hell ain\\'t your\\n Tommy: Get it together. We\\'re not alone.\\n Joel: I got two walking in.\\n Tommy: There\\'s more inside already.\\n Joel: Hang back.\\n Tommy: Watch yourself.\\n Joel: Alright...house is clear.\\n Tommy: Let\\'s get back to the horses.\\n Joel: We\\'re clear.\\n Tommy: You want a hand up?\\n Ellie: I got it. C\\'mon...\\n Tommy: Easy...easy... Whoa... There she is. Kids\\'ll be watching movies tonight.\\n Joel: Where is this lab of theirs?\\n Tommy: It\\'s all the way out -- University of Eastern Colorado.\\n Joel: Go Big Horns. Ellie, get off your horse, give it on back to Tommy. I\\'m\\n Tommy: What are you doin\\'?\\n Joel: Your wife kinda scares me. I don\\'t want her coming after me.\\n Ellie: Sorry for stealing your horse.\\n Tommy: Look, come back to town, let\\'s discuss it at least.\\n Joel: Eh, you know me. My mind\\'s all made up.\\n Joel: University Eastern Colorado. How do I find this lab?\\n Tommy: It\\'s in the science building, looks like a giant mirror, you can\\'t miss\\n Joel: You take care of that wife of yours.\\n Tommy: There\\'s a place for you here, you know.\\n Joel: You good?\\n Ellie: I\\'m good.\\n Joel: Adios, little brother. C\\'mon.\\n Ellie: So, let me see if I get it straight. If you mess up your fourth down,\\n Joel: Right, it\\'s called turnover.\\n Ellie: And if you clear the ten yards then you\\'re back at...first down?\\n Joel: First down, that\\'s right.\\n Ellie: Man, it\\'s confusing.\\n Joel: You just gotta play it a couple of times. It\\'ll all make sense.\\n Ellie: Okay. None of these buildings look like a mirror to me.\\n Joel: Well, we\\'ll head to central grounds. Should be able to see most of the\\n Joel: Stay, Callus. What kind of name is Callus anyway?\\n Ellie: Not my fault you forgot to ask Tommy his name.\\n Joel: Callus.\\n Ellie: So, these places...people would live here and just study? Even though\\n Joel: Yeah, study, party, and find themselves. Figure out what they wanted to\\n Ellie: What they wanted to do with their lives.\\n Joel: There was a lookout here.\\n Ellie: That\\'s a good sign.\\n Ellie: That\\'s a giant ram. You guys were like some idol worshippers.\\n Joel: When it came to sports? Hell yeah.\\n Ellie: Ooh...it\\'s getting chilly.\\n Joel: It\\'s that time of year.\\n Ellie: Hey, over there. Is that it?\\n Joel: Hmm. It does look like a giant mirror.\\n Ellie: How many people you think are there? Fireflies, I mean.\\n Joel: Reckon it takes quite a crew to run that operation.\\n Ellie: You think there\\'ll be other people my age?\\n Joel: Ahh...I\\'m not sure.\\n Joel: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...what is it, boy?\\n Ellie: Sounds like runners.\\n Joel: Stay with the horse. I\\'ll go check it out.\\n Ellie: Are you sure?\\n Joel: Yes. I don\\'t want him runnin\\' off. I\\'ll be right back.\\n Joel: Huh, looks like someone jerry-rigged this thing. No juice. I\\'ll see if\\n Joel: And that\\'s that.\\n Ellie: Hey, I was thinking...I would\\'ve wanted to be an astronaut.\\n Joel: That a fact?\\n Ellie: Yeah. Can you imagine being up there all by yourself? Would\\'ve be cool.\\n Joel: Oh...well, when I was a kid I used to want to be a...a singer.\\n Ellie: Shut up.\\n Joel: I\\'m serious.\\n Ellie: Sing something.\\n Joel: Ah, no.\\n Ellie: Come on. I won\\'t laugh.\\n Joel: I don\\'t think so.\\n Ellie: Joel. Please.\\n Ellie: Aww...are those monkeys?\\n Joel: Yeah, a whole mess of \\'em.\\n Ellie: That was kind of awesome.\\n Joel: First time seeing a monkey?\\n Ellie: First time seeing a monkey.\\n Ellie: Should we have seen someone by now?\\n Joel: Uh...maybe these guys like to keep a low profile.\\n Ellie: Yeah. Maybe.\\n Ellie: Hey, look. Fireflies. Joel, look!\\n Joel: I see it.\\n Ellie: This is good. First sign of Fireflies.\\n Joel: Alright, let\\'s try that gate.\\n Ellie: There it is. This won\\'t budge.\\n Ellie: Watch yourself.\\n Joel: You too. Oh, damn it. Spores.\\n Joel: Shit...\\n Ellie: Joel! Are you OK? What happened in there?\\n Joel: More infected. I\\'m fine!\\n Ellie: Here, come open the gate.\\n Joel: Alright. Let\\'s try the gate.\\n Ellie: You did it!\\n Joel: Yeah. Come on through. Scootch.\\n Ellie: Those clickers -- you think they were Fireflies?\\n Joel: No...no, I don\\'t think so.\\n Ellie: Why would they have infected so close to the lab?\\n Joel: Bill used them as a form of defense. Maybe they\\'re doing the same.\\n Ellie: Yeah...I could see that.\\n Ellie: No guards. No nothing.\\n Joel: Yeah...I\\'d expect to see someone by now. Let\\'s get inside.\\n Ellie: Have you ever been to one of these?\\n Joel: What? A university?\\n Ellie: Yeah.\\n Joel: No, not as a student at least.\\n Ellie: Why not?\\n Joel: Uhh...I had Sarah when I was pretty young.\\n Ellie: Oh...were you married?\\n Joel: For a while.\\n Ellie: What happened?\\n Joel: Okay.\\n Ellie: Too much?\\n Joel: Too much.\\n Ellie: Are we ever gonna find living Fireflies?\\n Joel: We better.\\n Ellie: Hey, what about over there?\\n Joel: Yeah. That looks like a way in.\\n Joel: It\\'s rusted shut. We\\'ll have to find another way.\\n Ellie: Maybe we can get over it.\\n Joel: Whoa. Alright, not what I had in mind, but it\\'ll do.\\n Joel: Alright, we\\'re inside. C\\'mon, kiddo, gimme your hand. There you go.\\n Ellie: Thanks. Let\\'s look around.\\n Ellie: How will they do it?\\n Joel: Do what?\\n Ellie: Get the cure from me? You think it\\'ll hurt?\\n Joel: No, no. They\\'ll probably just draw some blood ?- it don\\'t hurt.\\n Ellie: I\\'ve gotten shots before. They vaccinated us at school. It sucked.\\n Ellie: Hello? Where are they?\\n Ellie: Yoohoo! Fireflies? Cure for mankind over here! Anyone?\\n Joel: Let\\'s keep it down until we figure out what\\'s going on.\\n Ellie: Nothing useful.\\n Joel: Ain\\'t nothin\\' here but a bunch of medical mumbo-jumbo.\\n Ellie: I don\\'t get it.\\n Joel: Looks like they all just packed up and left in a hurry.\\n Ellie: Maybe not all of \\'em.\\n Joel: Stay close.\\n Ellie: There are no bodies. That\\'s good, right?\\n Joel: If we find out where they went.\\n Joel: Shit!\\n Joel: Jesus. Well, at least it ain\\'t clickers.\\n Ellie: Yeah. No Fireflies either. Well, maybe in all that research they turned\\n Joel: Just keep searching, we\\'ll find something.\\n Voice: If you\\'re looking for the Fireflies, they\\'ve all left.\\n Ellie: Yeah, no shit.\\n Voice: I\\'m dead...or I will be soon. Got me some time to reflect.\\n Voice: ...been years that felt like we were!\\n Voice: ...fucking thing was a giant waste of ti--\\n Voice: ...not going to do this anymore...\\n Joel: Come on.\\n Voice: ...looking for the others, they\\'ve all returned to Saint Mary\\'s Hospital\\n Ellie: Do you know where that is?\\n Joel: I know the city.\\n Ellie: Is it far?\\n Joel: It ain\\'t close. I mean on horseback--\\n Ellie: What?\\n Ellie: Fireflies?\\n Joel: Get down!\\n Ellie: Who the fuck are these guys?\\n Joel: It don\\'t matter. We know where to go, let\\'s get the hell outta here.\\n Hunter: Got you, asshole.\\n Ellie: Oh shit. Oh man...\\n Ellie: What do you want me to do?\\n Joel: Move...\\n Ellie: What?\\n Joel: Move!\\n Ellie: Oh man...Joel? Oh...\\n Joel: I\\'m gonna need you to pull.\\n Ellie: Okay. Alright, you ready? One, two, three.\\n Joel: Pull!\\n Joel: Just get to the damn horse.\\n Ellie: Okay. I don\\'t see anyone. Let\\'s go! Joel, how are we doing?\\n Joel: I\\'m fine...I\\'m fine.\\n Ellie: Can you handle the window?\\n Joel: Yeah.\\n Ellie: Okay.\\n Ellie: Jesus. Come on, move!\\n Hunter: I see you!\\n Ellie: Shit.\\n Hunter: Come on, man.\\n Ellie: Alright, just stay here. I\\'m gonna flank this asshole.\\n Joel: Ellie.\\n Hunter: Those were my friends you killed, asshole. Come on out. You want to\\n Hunter: You little bitch.\\n Joel: Shit.\\n Ellie: Oh man, we gotta get you out of here.\\n Joel: I\\'m okay.\\n Ellie: You\\'re not okay, Joel! Now come on! Move it. There\\'s no one here. Hurry.\\n Ellie: You\\'re doing good, just keep at it.\\n Joel: I\\'m coming.\\n Ellie: Through these double doors. Oh man. Here, lean on me.\\n Joel: No.\\n Ellie: Well can you walk?\\n Joel: Yes.\\n Ellie: Then fucking walk. Come on. There\\'s the exit. Just a little bit more,\\n Joel: Behind you!\\n Ellie: What?\\n Joel: Ellie!\\n Hunter: The kid\\'s got a gun! Watch out! Hey!\\n Ellie: Stay the fuck back!\\n Ellie: Oh shit, oh shit.\\n Hunter 2: You little shit!\\n Ellie: Joel. Here, stand up. I swear to god, I get you out of this, you are so\\n Joel: You wish.\\n Ellie: Wait here. I\\'ll get the door.\\n Joel: Take your time.\\n Ellie: Come on. There you go.\\n Hunter: What the fuck? Ah, shit!\\n Ellie: Come on.\\n Joel: Just...get the horse.\\n Ellie: Alright... Can you get on?\\n Joel: Go.\\n Ellie: I think we\\'re safe. Joel. Joel.\\n Ellie: Ah, shit. Joel -- here. Get up, get up, get up... You gotta tell me\\n Ellie: Oh, this won\\'t last very long.\\n Ellie: You\\'ll just startle it.\\n Ellie: Where\\'d you go? There he is.\\n Ellie: Shit, he heard that.\\n Ellie: Oh man. How are you still alive?\\n Ellie: What is this place? Everything\\'s cool. This place is not creepy at all.\\n Ellie: Who\\'s there? Come out!\\n Man: Hello...we just want to talk.\\n Ellie: Any sudden moves and I put one right between your eyes. Ditto for\\n David: Um, name\\'s David, this here\\'s my friend James. We\\'re from a larger\\n Ellie: So am I -- women and children -- all very hungry too.\\n David: Well maybe we could, ah, trade you for some of that meat there. What do\\n Ellie: Medicine! Do you have any antibiotics?\\n David: We do. Back at the camp. You\\'re welcome to follow us--\\n Ellie: I\\'m not following you anywhere. Buddy boy can go get it. He comes back\\n David: You put one right between my eyes.\\n Ellie: That\\'s right.\\n David: Two bottles of penicillin and a syringe. Make it fast. Go on.\\n Ellie: I\\'ll take that rifle.\\n David: Of course.\\n Ellie: Back up.\\n David: He\\'s probably gonna be awhile. You, ah, mind if we take some shelter\\n Ellie: Bring him with us.\\n David: There. You know you really shouldn\\'t be out here all on your own.\\n Ellie: I don\\'t like company.\\n David: I see. What\\'s your name?\\n Ellie: Why?\\n David: Look, I understand it\\'s not easy to trust a couple of strangers.\\n Ellie: We\\'ll see.\\n Ellie: You had another gun?\\n David: Sorry.\\n David: Okay, I\\'d really like my rifle back now.\\n Ellie: No, you have your pistol.\\n David: I hope you know how to use that thing.\\n Ellie: I\\'ve had some practice.\\n David: No matter what, we have to keep them out. Let\\'s hope they don\\'t find\\n Ellie: Okay.\\n David: Make every shot count now.\\n Ellie: I\\'ve done this before.\\n David: You weren\\'t kidding. You\\'re a better shot with that thing than I am.\\n Ellie: Agh, c\\'mon, c\\'mon.\\n Ellie: Oh shit.\\n David: Nothin\\' over here. Oh lord, there\\'s a whole lot of \\'em comin\\' at us.\\n David: Screw it. We\\'re gettin\\' outta this room!\\n David: Alright, kid. This way.\\n Ellie: Fucking infected.\\n David: C\\'mon. I\\'ll block their path. Cover the stairs!\\n David: Follow me. Through here.\\n Ellie: Okay. Do you know where you\\'re going?\\n David: I\\'ve never set foot in this place.\\n Ellie: Oh.

Looks like someone already fought those things and lost.\\n David: Ah, Lord. I\\'ve been lookin\\' for these boys. Doesn\\'t matter. Grab their\\n Ellie: See anything?\\n David: It\\'s a dead end. How on earth did they use this building?\\n Ellie: So what do we do?\\n David: We hold our ground.\\n Ellie: Is there any other choice?\\n David: We die. Get ready.\\n Ellie: You hear that? They\\'re on the roof!\\n David: I know!\\n David: We\\'re doin\\' fine, kid.\\n Ellie: It doesn\\'t feel like it.\\n David: Just stay focused. We\\'ll make it. Here come more!\\n Ellie: How many of these things are there?\\n David: I have no idea.

It\\'s not your fault. You\\'re just a kid. James,\\n James: No way, David. I\\'m not gonna let her go.\\n David: Lower the gun. Now give her the medicine.\\n James: The others won\\'t be happy about this.\\n David: Yeah, well, that\\'s not your concern.\\n Ellie: Move the fuck out of the way.\\n David: You won\\'t survive long out there. I can protect you.\\n Ellie: No thanks.\\n Ellie: Let\\'s get outta here. Come on.\\n Ellie: Come on. Okay...\\n Ellie: Joel? Oh... I only managed to get a little bit of food. But...I did get\\n Ellie: Sorry. All done. That\\'s it. You\\'re gonna make it.\\n Ellie: Oh, fuck. They tracked me. I\\'m gonna draw them away from here. I\\'ll come\\n Ellie: Easy... Go...

Okay...\\n Hunter: She fell down the hill somewhere. I don\\'t see her though.\\n Hunter 2: She\\'s running for the cabins!\\n Hunter: Are we really killing her? David said he wants her alive.\\n Hunter 2: He doesn\\'t get to make that call. James to me it\\'s the girl from\\n Hunter: Oh shit. I didn\\'t know that was her. Screw David, then. I ain\\'t taking\\n Hunter 2: I just want to finish up and go home. I\\'m freezing my ass off.\\n Ellie: Nature track... Okay, that should get me out of here. You got this,\\n Ellie: Here we go. I got this. Agh...\\n Ellie: That\\'s the way back. Hang in there, Joel.\\n Hunter: Cover the grounds! Make sure she\\'s not hiding somewhere over here!\\n Ellie: How do I get outta here?\\n Ellie: I don\\'t wanna get trapped in here. Agh, where\\'s the way out?\\n Hunter: She\\'s on this side of the lodge!\\n David: Relax... Keeping you alive here. There you go. There you go.\\n Ellie: Oh...\\n David: How are you feeling?\\n Ellie: Super.\\n David: Here. You should eat. I know you\\'re hungry -- been out for quite some\\n Ellie: What is it?\\n David: It\\'s deer.\\n Ellie: With some human helping on the side?\\n David: No. No, I promise. It\\'s...just the deer meat.\\n Ellie: You\\'re a fucking animal.\\n David: Oh...you\\'re awfully quick to judgment. Considering you and your friend\\n Ellie: They didn\\'t give us a choice.\\n David: And you think we have a choice? Is that it? You kill to survive...and\\n Ellie: So now what? You gonna chop me up into tiny pieces?\\n David: I\\'d rather not. Please tell me your name.\\n Ellie: You\\'re so full of shit.\\n David: On the contrary, I\\'ve been, ah, been quite honest with you. Now I think\\n Ellie: Convince them of what?\\n David: That you can come around. You have heart. You\\'re loyal. And you\\'re\\n Ellie: Oh...\\n Ellie: Oh, fuck...\\n David: You stupid little girl. You are making it very difficult to keep you\\n Ellie: Ellie.\\n David: What?\\n Ellie: Tell them that...Ellie is the little girl that broke your fucking\\n David: How did you put it? Hmm?
